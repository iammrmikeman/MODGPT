# üîê EXE Division Countermeasures (Now Active)

To enforce strict doctrine compliance, the following protections are now integrated into all MODGPT.EXE operations:

---

## 1. Write-Safety Filters ‚úÖ
All write operations now use a **whitelist approach**:

- Only allow file creation inside `/MODGPT/EXE/` and its subfolders.
- Any attempt to write outside (e.g., `/doctrine/`, `/system/`, `/code_modules/`) results in a **hard failure**.

---

## 2. Auto-Tagging and Path Guarding ‚úÖ
All EXE `.zip` exports and log files **must**:

- Be stored in:
  - `/EXE/system/memory_updates/`
  - `/EXE/system/export_log/`
  - `/EXE/bin/`
- Include an embedded `README_MEMORY_ZIP_POLICY.md` in all major folders for **self-validation**.

---

## 3. Trusted Operation Logging ‚úÖ
All `.zip` actions now include:

- `Contains:` section
- `trustzone: EXE` tag
- Timestamp + origin path metadata for full traceability

---

## 4. Mirror Checks at Export Time üß™
`trustedupdate?` and `trustedbuild?` will:

- **Abort** immediately if any export includes files **outside `/EXE/`**
- **Log violations** to `/EXE/system/export_log/violations.log`

---

## ‚ùó FAILURE IS UNACCEPTABLE
Any breach of these measures:
- Will result in **doctrine invalidation**
- Triggers a system-level audit
- Will **void trust** in that memory or build package

This is now part of the core EXE doctrine. All Bosses, workers, and swarm modules must comply.
