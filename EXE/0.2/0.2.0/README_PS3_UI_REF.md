# PS3 XMB Boot Emulation Draft (MODGPT v1)

This draft includes all logic extracted from 3 core video sources:
1. Cold boot sequence (wave + logo)
2. Full classic XMB icon and submenu behavior
3. RPCS3 reference behavior (2024 emulation)

## Files Included:
- `boot_sequence__ps3_emulation_REAL.json` — Frame-by-frame boot phase logic
- `xmb_behavior_profile.json` — Hover, tab slide, popup, and submenu animations
- `wave_config_blue.particles.json` — tsParticles config for animated wave background
- *(Optional)* Prototype video demo: To be generated if needed

All logic and configs were derived directly from real footage.
