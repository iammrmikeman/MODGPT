# Simulated Rockstar Board Meetings

## Simulation: June 2025 – Rockstar Legal Board Review

**Agenda:**  
Evaluate threat level and response options regarding MODGPT and RockstarGPT—an AI-generated modding system leveraging company analysis, historic patterns, and modder compliance tools.

**Key Points Raised:**
- System shows clear evidence of transformative intent.
- Legal infringement unlikely unless tied to multiplayer or asset dumping.
- PR backlash from mod takedown could outweigh legal gain.
- RockstarGPT frames Rockstar as worthy of study, not exploitation.

**Decisions Simulated:**
1. **C&D Threat:** 40% chance. Tied to mod popularity or media coverage.
2. **Silence & Monitor:** 35% chance. Wait for misstep, then strike.
3. **Contact Author Privately:** 20% chance. Vet for employment or neutralization.
4. **Public Acknowledgement/Partnership:** 5% chance. Only if community pressure builds.

**Final Simulated Outcome:**  
> “No immediate legal action. Monitor evolution. Prepare response kit if traction grows.”

*Simulation modeled on Rockstar's historic behavior patterns, industry trends, and PR risk scoring.*
