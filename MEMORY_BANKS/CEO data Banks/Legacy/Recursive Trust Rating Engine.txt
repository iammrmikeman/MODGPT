This window is part of GTAV MODGPT. Inherit memory. Create and test a recursive trust rating engine for mods and zip files.

**ChatGPT:**

Understood. Initializing Recursive Trust Rating Engine (RTRE) v0.01 for GTAV MODGPT. This module will evaluate the trustworthiness of mods and .zip files recursively across all mod components, metadata, file structure, and historical performance.

üß† MODGPT: Recursive Trust Rating Engine (RTRE) v0.01
‚úÖ PURPOSE:

To assess how trustworthy a .zip mod archive is, in terms of:

Mod integrity

File completeness

Build reproducibility

Runtime stability

Internal consistency across versions

Alignment with MODGPT policy standards

üîÅ ENGINE LOOP DESIGN:
1. INPUT VALIDATION

Check .zip for:

Corruption

Unusually low size (e.g., <4 KB = fail-safe trigger)

Expected file extensions (.h, .cpp, .vcxproj, manifest, etc.)

File/folder count thresholds

2. STRUCTURE CHECK

Does it follow MODGPT format? (e.g., /src, /build, /doc, etc.)

Are build-critical files in expected locations?

Any placeholder, stub, or TODO content?

3. MANIFEST CROSS-VALIDATION

Check for existence of manifest (mod.json, manifest.json, gptaid.txt)

Parse manifest and verify version, changelog, hash consistency

Trust tags ("trusted": true) only accepted if manifest matches zip contents

4. BUILD HISTORY & VERSION ANCESTRY

If previous versions exist:

Compare deltas (added/removed files, logic diffs)

Reuse historical trust metrics if ancestry is clean

5. SYMBOLIC BUILD TEST

Do a non-invasive compile simulation (dry run)

Header/linker dependencies resolved?

Project files intact?

Visual Studio project usable?

6. EXECUTION STABILITY SIMULATION

Simulate .asi runtime behavior:

Does the thread yield?

Any infinite loop risk?

Any dangerous natives or system calls?

7. RECURSIVE INTEGRITY CHECK

Recursively inspect:

External dependency claims (e.g., ScriptHookV SDK)

Inner zip references (zip-in-zip logic)

Known bad patterns (e.g., junk injectors, stubbed ScriptMain())

üßÆ OUTPUT: TRUST SCORE SYSTEM
Score	Meaning	Action
üîí 5.0 (LOCKED)	Confirmed Trusted (by policy + build + run)	Can be used in release, public-facing
‚úÖ 4.0	High Trust ‚Äî Passed all checks	Safe for use, may need final human review
‚ö†Ô∏è 3.0	Medium Trust ‚Äî Minor issues	Use with caution. Run test asi and verify manually
‚ùå 2.0	Low Trust ‚Äî Structural problems	Do not use. Requires fixing and retesting
üö´ 1.0	Critical Failure ‚Äî Incomplete or corrupted	Reject. Auto quarantine. No build or execution allowed

All scoring is deterministic and reproducible. Versions are always compared using hash+manifest pairings.

üß™ TEST MODE

To test the engine now:

‚úÖ Upload a .zip file (mod source or compiled archive).
üîÑ I will run RTRE on it and display:

Trust score

Trust evolution across versions

Detailed trust error log

Or you may run:

pgsql
trusted? filename.zip


To begin test mode manually.

Would you like to:

Upload a zip now for testing?

Run this engine retroactively on an existing trusted mod/version?

Enable persistent trust logging for all future .zip evaluations?

Let me know and I‚Äôll continue setup accordingly.
