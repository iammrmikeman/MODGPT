**ChatGPT:**

Here is a Reliability Verification Checklist tailored for HeadShotV builds ‚Äî optimized to confirm no null pointers, unlinked functions, or placeholder logic make it into the final .asi or release state.

‚úÖ HeadShotV Reliability Verification Checklist (MODGPT v0.01 Trusted Build Protocol)
üîπ 1. Null Pointer Defense

 All pointer allocations are validated
if (ptr == nullptr) checks exist after any new, malloc, Get*, or external API pointer return.

 No pointer arithmetic without prior null check
Verify raw ptr + X or ptr->member has a preceding or wrapped null assertion.

 All external return pointers checked
Functions like FindPedByID, GetEntityFromPool, or ScriptHookV natives are confirmed non-null before use.

 Smart pointers (if used) checked for .get()/.use_count() before dereference

üîπ 2. Unlinked or Undefined Function Detection

 No function stubs or unlinked calls
Run symbol resolution pass on all compiled units ‚Äî every declared function must resolve to a definition or linked external.

 Verify natives.h symbols used match ScriptHookV SDK version
No calls to removed/renamed or misspelled native functions.

 No unresolved external symbols on final link pass
Run with /VERBOSE:UNUSED and /FORCE:UNRESOLVED suppressed ‚Äî report must show no missing entry points.

 All .cpp files compiled and linked in .vcxproj
Audit for orphaned logic or files excluded from build.

üîπ 3. Placeholder / Incomplete Logic Sweep

 Zero TODO, FIXME, or PLACEHOLDER comments present
Enforced via grep or regex on all source files:

regex
\b(TODO|FIXME|PLACEHOLDER|XXX|STUB|UNIMPLEMENTED)\b


 No empty if/else/switch blocks
Every control structure must have at least minimal logic (LOG_DEBUG, assertion, or fail-safe).

 No return; or return 0; in functions marked // temp or // stub

 No commented-out legacy code with uncertain purpose
Clear commented blocks must be either removed or annotated with // PRESERVED BY DESIGN.

 Critical functions (e.g., headshot damage, trigger detection, angle checks) must not contain default returns or fake logic for testing.

üîπ 4. MODGPT Static Rule Checks (Automated Pass)

 Run modgpt_staticcheck.py (or internal logic auditor)
‚úì Confirms all native call signatures match SDK
‚úì Reports use of unsafe or deprecated API
‚úì Logs unreachable code paths
‚úì Detects overly broad try/catch blocks or silent failure modes

üîπ 5. Behavioral Sanity Audit

 Enable runtime logging for target build (--diagnostic true)

 Confirm all hooks (e.g., Ped OnHit, Weapon Fire, Bone Checks) are invoked during at least 1 gameplay scenario

 Force test with intentionally null entities or out-of-bounds IDs
Must not crash. Should log clean error with unique code.

üîπ 6. Release Readiness Final Checks

 Manifest contains version, hash, changelog, and all required fields (trusted? protocol)

 Build passes MODGPT trusted preflight:

No placeholders

All natives resolved

All headers used and valid

No obvious simulation-only logic (e.g., simulateHitResult())

‚ö†Ô∏è BONUS (Optional but Recommended)

 Use AddressSanitizer in debug mode to catch memory issues.

 Run with ScriptHookV log hook enabled to confirm all native failures throw alerts.

 Inject nullptr on all GameEntity* accessors at least once ‚Äî ensure fallback logic works.

Would you like this formalized into a .checklist.json, a CI test suite, or tracked in swarm memory per build?
