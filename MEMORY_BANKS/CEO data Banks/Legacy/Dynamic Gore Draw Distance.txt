**You:**

Design a dynamic draw distance manager so gore remains visible even when far away but doesnâ€™t cause memory spikes.

**ChatGPT:**

To keep gore assets (like blood splatters, dismembered limbs, or headburst models) visible at long distances without triggering VRAM spikes, entity pool overflow, or LOD glitches, we need a dynamic draw distance manager tailored to GTA V's internal streaming and memory systems.

âœ… GOAL

Keep gore assets visible from medium-to-far range (~50â€“300m) even if normal LOD would unload them.

Avoid memory spikes due to too many high-res assets being kept alive across the map.

Work within ScriptHookV runtime, no .meta edits allowed.

Support scalable systems (e.g., distant low-poly corpses, only high-res gore nearby).

ðŸ§  System Name: GoreDrawManager
ðŸ§© CORE CONCEPT

Use a central memory-managed controller (GoreDrawManager) that:

Tracks all gore entities created.

Monitors distance to player camera.

Dynamically toggles LOD, visibility, and material detail based on distance.

Replaces faraway gore with proxies (e.g., flat decals or baked LODs).

Queues removals when limits approach (reaper system).

ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS
1. Gore Registration System
cpp
struct GoreEntity {
    Entity handle;
    Vector3 position;
    int lodLevel;
    bool isVisible;
    bool isProxy;
};
std::vector<GoreEntity> trackedGore;


On gore creation, register it here.

2. Distance-Based Draw Manager Loop
cpp
void UpdateGoreDrawDistances() {
    Vector3 camPos = CAM::GET_GAMEPLAY_CAM_COORD();
    for (auto& gore : trackedGore) {
        float dist = VDIST(gore.position.x, gore.position.y, gore.position.z, camPos.x, camPos.y, camPos.z);

        if (dist < 30.0f) {
            SetGoreHighDetail(gore);
        } else if (dist < 100.0f) {
            SetGoreMediumDetail(gore);
        } else if (dist < 250.0f) {
            SetGoreLowDetailOrProxy(gore);
        } else {
            RemoveOrCullGore(gore);
        }
    }
}


Runs every few frames on a background thread or tick hook.

3. Gore LOD/Proxy Swapping
cpp
void SetGoreHighDetail(GoreEntity& gore) {
    if (gore.isProxy) {
        ReplaceProxyWithReal(gore);
    }
    ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_VISIBLE(gore.handle, true, false);
    ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_LOD_DIST(gore.handle, 300); // Max LOD
    gore.lodLevel = 3;
}

void SetGoreMediumDetail(GoreEntity& gore) {
    ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_LOD_DIST(gore.handle, 100); // Lower LOD
    gore.lodLevel = 2;
}

void SetGoreLowDetailOrProxy(GoreEntity& gore) {
    if (!gore.isProxy) {
        ReplaceRealWithProxy(gore); // Flat decal, low-poly mesh, or just baked blood sprite
        gore.isProxy = true;
    }
    gore.lodLevel = 1;
}

4. Memory Safety: Gore Reaper

If the number of registered gore entities exceeds a threshold (e.g. 80):

cpp
void CullOldestGore() {
    if (trackedGore.size() > 80) {
        GoreEntity& oldest = trackedGore.front();
        ENTITY::SET_ENTITY_AS_MISSION_ENTITY(oldest.handle, true, true);
        ENTITY::DELETE_ENTITY(&oldest.handle);
        trackedGore.erase(trackedGore.begin());
    }
}


Called in UpdateGoreDrawDistances() after iteration.

5. Optional: Dynamic Material Switching

For real gore meshes:

Use SET_ENTITY_ALPHA() to fade in/out gore.

Use SET_ENTITY_LOD_DIST() in combination with low-memory versions of the materials (swappable .ydr).

ðŸ“ˆ Optimization Strategy
Distance	Action	Reason
0â€“30m	Full model, full shader, max LOD	Player is close; visual fidelity needed
30â€“100m	Mesh stays, LOD reduced, effects fade out	Saves VRAM, keeps silhouette visible
100â€“250m	Swap with proxy or billboard version	Prevents spikes from geometry batching
250m+	Entity deleted or hidden	Not visible, not worth GPU budget
ðŸ§ª Test Conditions

Spawn 100 gore heads in a radius around the player.

Enable flying camera and simulate zooming out.

Log draw calls and memory spikes.

Observe if proxy mode kicks in without crashes or FPS drops.

ðŸ›  Native Functions Used
Function	Purpose
SET_ENTITY_LOD_DIST	Control draw distance directly
SET_ENTITY_VISIBLE	Force hide/show manually
SET_ENTITY_ALPHA	Optional: Fade effects
DELETE_ENTITY	Cull faraway assets
IS_ENTITY_VISIBLE	Debug visibility checks
ðŸ”’ Failsafe Extensions

Tag every gore model with a runtime-generated ID (DECAL_GORE_xxx) so they can be batch-deleted on cleanup.

Use a soft memory warning counter: if memory hits unsafe thresholds, downgrade all gore LODs globally.
