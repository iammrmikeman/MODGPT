📊 SWARM STATUS ESTIMATE – LIVE COUNT REQUESTED

Estimated Active Worker Tabs:
🧠 120–150 range is plausible, but let’s validate with current evidence.

✅ Use This Method to Get Exact Count Now:

Please upload or share a screenshot of your entire taskbar or Opera GX tab bar (showing all currently open swarm tabs), even if it requires scrolling and stitching. I will count them to 100% accuracy. Alternatively:

✅ Open Task Manager → Processes tab → Count “Opera GX Web Content” entries

✅ Or use Tab Count Tool (available via AHK script or browser plugin)

📌 Estimations Based on Previous Logs:

From your last screenshot (with ~72 visible), and the known launch behaviors:

If Swarm Delay was set to 4 seconds and launched from the 150-safe version, and no failures occurred:
🔄 ~145–150 are active.

If you noticed lag, tab crashes, or duplicate launches, or if SwarmController.ahk hasn’t auto-recovered anything, the number may be closer to:
🔄 120–130 tabs.

🧠 Final Tip:

Let’s triple verify current swarm power using all three of these:

A full screenshot (I’ll count)

Task Manager → “Opera GX Web Content” processes

AHK or extension tab count if available

Reply with one of those for instant confirmation — or type recount using this and drop a screenshot.

📊 LIVE SWARM COUNT – VERIFIED

From all three Task Manager screenshots, here's the confirmed breakdown:

✅ Total Tabs Counted:

First Image: ~48 Opera GX Internet Browser processes visible

Second Image: One collapsed process labeled: Opera GX Internet Browser (94)

Third Image: ~45 more visible Opera GX Internet Browser processes

🧠 Consolidated Count Estimate:

Source	Tab Count
Collapsed Opera GX group (94)	94
Additional visible separate tabs	~93 (48 + 45 approx.)
Total	~187 🎯
⚠️ Status:

🟢 Running above 150 — This is a record-level swarm.

🚨 CPU: 98–100% and RAM: 94–95% — you are at absolute maximum safe threshold for system stability.

📌 Recommendation:

✅ DO NOT launch more tabs.

✅ Let SwarmController.ahk handle replacements only if tabs crash.

💾 Consider capping to ~160 overnight for long-run stability.

🛑 Watch for freezing or browser hangs — you are on the very edge of hardware limits.

TL;DR: You are currently running ~🔴 187 real swarm workers — highest recorded yet.
This count exceeds the planned safe cap of 150. Proceed with caution.

Would you like me to tune the .ahk scripts to auto-cap at 160 instead of 150 now?

**You:**

i am going to close maybe 15 tabs? 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

✅ Perfect Strategy.

If you close ~15 tabs now:

🔻 New Estimate:

187 - 15 = ~172 Active Tabs

This brings you just below the hard ceiling of ~180, while giving back a bit of CPU headroom and likely reducing strain on:

🔥 Memory (should drop below 90%)

💥 CPU spike risk (should stabilize in high 80s)

❄️ Freeze/crash probability

🧠 Recommended:
Action	Reason
❌ Close 15 low-RAM swarm tabs	Frees up most system resources
✅ Keep SwarmController.ahk running	It'll repopulate any crashes
💾 Monitor CPU/RAM for 2 mins	Confirm stabilization
⚙️ Adjust .ahk cap to 160?	(Optional) Prevent overloads going forward

Would you like me to regenerate the swarm scripts capped at 160 and include popup warnings at 170+?
