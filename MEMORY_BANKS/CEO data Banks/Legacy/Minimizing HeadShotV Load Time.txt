**ChatGPT:**

As a startup-time specialist focused on HeadShotV (a precision mod for GTA V), the goal is to minimize perceived and actual delay between game launch and the mod becoming fully active. Below is a structured strategy set, broken into pre-injection, runtime, and persistent caching phases â€” all designed for Enhanced Edition under ScriptHookV with clean native linkage.

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 1: Pre-Injection Optimization
1. Lazy Native Resolution

Only resolve ScriptHookV native hashes on first call instead of all at once.

Wrap calls in macro or inline-resolver that caches the result:

cpp
#define NATIVE_CALL(hash) ([] { static auto fn = NativeInvoke::Resolve(hash); return fn; })()

2. Static Memory Allocation

Replace new or malloc with statically-sized pools (no heap fragmentation on load).

For example, use fixed-size circular buffers for:

Aim target history

Recent hit logs

HUD draw calls

3. Single-Time Hook Injection

Inject your input/camera/draw hooks only once during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, not repeatedly or via game-thread polling.

Verify that SHV main loop is used for mod update loop (scriptMain()).

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 2: Runtime Initialization Delay Minimization
4. Staggered System Activation

Instead of initializing all subsystems (targeting, prediction, HUD, profiler) in OnInit, stagger across 3â€“5 game ticks using a mod state machine.

cpp
enum class ModState { Booting, CoreReady, UIReady, Active };

5. Pre-Warm Native Calls

Pre-call critical natives during the loading screen (e.g. GET_PLAYER_PED, GET_ENTITY_COORDS) so SHV caches them.

6. File IO Thread Separation

Move all config reads (settings.json, manifest.json, etc.) to a separate thread before scriptMain() begins.

Fallback: use memory-mapped files (Windows CreateFileMapping).

ðŸ”¹ PHASE 3: Persistent Preload and Caching
7. Persistent Mod State Cache

Write a .cache file after each successful run that includes:

Resolved native hash addresses

Last used settings

Recent target model hashes (to avoid PED scan at launch)

Load this file immediately on launch with:

cpp
std::ifstream in("hs_cache.bin", std::ios::binary);

8. GPU Command Warmup

If using DRAW_RECT, SET_TEXT_* or HUD natives, issue 1 fake command per type during splash to warm up draw pipeline.

9. ScriptHookV Lazy Thread Deferral

Avoid spawning multiple SHV script threads â€” use one master script thread with an update() switchboard. This reduces internal SHV thread contention.

ðŸ”¹ Optional: Debug-Time Optimization Flags

For builds under development:

Add a --fastload CLI flag to:

Skip non-critical checks (e.g. update pings, telemetry)

Preload last known working settings

Suppress debug HUD

ðŸ§  Bonus: Deep OS-Level Enhancements (Advanced)

Use SetProcessPriorityClass() to boost GTA V to HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS on mod injection.

Hook SHV's init thread and yield CPU back until your load dependencies are ready â€” no premature CPU starvation.

ðŸ§¾ Summary of Key Startup Reducers
Component	Optimization	Gain Estimate
Native resolution	Lazy resolve with cache	-50â€“150ms
HUD and Draw init	Fake GPU commands	-100ms
File reads	IO thread or mmap	-200ms
Subsystem boot	Ticked staggered load	-500ms+
Persistent cache	Load resolved addresses/settings	-1000ms
Process priority	High-priority execution yield on load	-50â€“300ms

Would you like me to build a full preload module, or prepare a test zip to benchmark these startup reductions?
