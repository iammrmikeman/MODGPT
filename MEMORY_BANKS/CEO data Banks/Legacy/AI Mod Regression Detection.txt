**ChatGPT:**

To design an AI-powered regression detection system for mod builds, especially for something like HeadShotV, we must blend automated benchmarking, semantic bug memory, and build lineage intelligence. Below is a full architecture-level plan divided into 7 key modules, followed by how they integrate into MODGPT:

‚úÖ 1. Build Regression Detector (Core Logic Module)

Purpose:
Flags any new build that shows degraded behavior relative to prior trusted builds.

Inputs:

Current build version and source .zip

Prior trusted build metadata

Performance metrics (FPS, latency, memory usage, hit-detection lag)

Bug logs (runtime, compiler, AI-logged issues)

Detection Triggers:

FPS drop > X% over benchmark baseline

New crash points not seen in trusted builds

Increase in system lag, stutter, or draw call delay

Missed functionality (e.g. feature vanished)

Log growth > Y KB (sign of error spam, misloops)

Regression Scoring Formula:

plaintext
RegressionScore = 
    (PerfDrop * W1) +
    (NewBugs * W2) +
    (MissedFeatures * W3) +
    (CrashFrequencyIncrease * W4)


Where Wn are dynamic weights based on severity.

‚úÖ 2. Performance Profiler Bot

Purpose:
Runs each .asi in a controlled environment (real or simulated) and captures:

Microsecond-level timing of native calls

Frame time spikes / stalls

Mod-specific metrics like hit/miss logic duration

Outputs:

Time-series logs

Performance profile diff vs last 3 trusted builds

‚ÄúHeat map‚Äù of expensive functions

‚úÖ 3. Bug Fingerprint Engine

Purpose:
AI-powered comparison of error messages, logs, and crash patterns.

Logic:

Convert each error into a hashed fingerprint (based on stack trace, function calls, message patterns)

Check against historical fingerprint DB of all prior bugs

If new errors exist with no prior match ‚Üí "NEW BUG"

Bonus:
Clusters regressions into "families" (e.g. memory leaks, ScriptHookV issues, missing manifest keys).

‚úÖ 4. Behavioral Function Validator

Purpose:
Ensures that key gameplay functions (like RegisterHeadshot(), PlayKillCam(), ApplyRagdollForce()) still:

Exist

Behave within expected tolerances

Return valid results

Uses GPT-based simulated testers + internal unit assertions.

‚úÖ 5. Trusted Build Ledger + Lineage Tree

Purpose:
Maintains a versioned chain-of-trust. Every build is:

Compared against its parent build

Checked for additive, subtractive, or mutated logic

Flagged if a feature was lost without version note

Includes:

Build Hash

Feature Set Hash

Dependency Tree

Confidence Score (from previous build results)

‚úÖ 6. Semantic Diff Analyzer (AI-level)

Purpose:
Goes beyond file diffs ‚Äî uses LLM to detect:

Subtle API contract violations

Renamed but not refactored logic

Hidden bugs introduced by optimization attempts

Example:

If IsValidTarget() now returns true for dead peds ‚Äî this gets flagged as a semantic logic regression even if tests pass.

‚úÖ 7. Regression Dashboard (UI / Dev Interface)

Purpose:
Expose all of the above visually for dev review:

Timeline of build performance

Detected regressions by category

Trust ladder (promote/demote builds)

Diff explorer (side-by-side bug/feature/logic view)

Integration:
Can run standalone or embed inside the MODGPT ‚ÄúBoss Mode‚Äù diagnostic panel.

üîÑ Workflow Integration into MODGPT

Post-Build Hook:
Every time a mod is built (build or test asi), this system runs full regression checks.

Regression Alert System:
If a regression is detected, GPT marks the build as UNTRUSTED until confirmed by human or resolved.

Memory Logging:
Any regression bug is burned into MODGPT‚Äôs long-term error memory (BUGBOOK + version fingerprint).

Swarm Task Spawning:
If a regression is found:

GPT can automatically spawn fix suggestion threads

Propose auto-rollback or dual-build comparison

Trigger confidence recalibration

üß† Bonus: ‚ÄúTrust Inheritance‚Äù Heuristic

If a new build is structurally identical to a prior trusted build but with only comments or doc changes, it inherits prior trust level unless runtime proves otherwise.

üèÅ Next Steps

If you approve this system design, I‚Äôll:

Generate pseudocode or functional scripts for each module

Design a ‚Äútrust.json‚Äù manifest schema for storing per-build confidence and regression data

Auto-patch this into the MODGPT preflight pipeline
