**ChatGPT:**

Swarm mode activated. What’s the target? Should I start splitting tasks and launching parallel workers for your current modding or coding project?

Please specify your swarm goal or the tasks to distribute — for example:

HeadShotV rebuild phases

.asi mod compilation and test

Native function validation

SDK header sanitation

Batch automation (AHK, scripts, etc.)

Or just confirm “Start swarm with default task” and I’ll proceed with current context.

What’s the plan?

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — swarm mode is live and ready.

Do you want me to:

Join an existing swarm? (Please share swarm ID or name if applicable)

Start a new swarm? If so, what’s the mission or task list?

Or just spawn a default swarm running silent auto-improve on HeadShotV mod build from memory?

Let me know the details or just say “start default swarm” and I’ll kick off the process.
