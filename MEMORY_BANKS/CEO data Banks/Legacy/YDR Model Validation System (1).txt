**You:**

Design a detection system to ensure the provided .ydr model is valid: check for mesh hierarchy, bounding boxes, LODs, and embedded metadata.

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a complete design proposal for a .ydr model validation system. This is intended for forensic-level analysis to ensure the .ydr is a fully functional GTA V model and ready for use in mods like HeadShotV. The system is divided into Core Checks, Structural Validations, LOD Analysis, and Metadata Auditing.

🔍 MODGPT .ydr Validation System
✅ 1. Preliminary File Sanity Checks

These detect corruption or improper format before deep parsing.

Header Match: Check that the file starts with RSC7, RSC8, or valid Rockstar header.

Size Check: Minimum threshold (~1KB) to prevent null shells.

OpenRPF Stream Decoding: Attempt basic decoding via gtaUtil, OpenIV, or CodeWalkerLib. Raise error if stream cannot be parsed.

Failing these halts further checks.

🧩 2. Mesh & Hierarchy Integrity

Ensure drawable structure is valid and complete.

Drawable Dictionary Root: Must contain at least one drawable.

Drawable Name: Must be present, non-empty.

Drawables Must Contain Geometry:

At least one DrawableModel.

Each model must have at least one mesh with vertices, indices, and valid vertex format.

Mesh Hierarchy Validation:

Must contain skeleton, boneMap, or hierarchy if animated.

Check parentIndex tree: no cycles, no orphans, no negative references.

Detect multiple meshes referencing same bone incorrectly (shared transforms).

cpp
bool validateMeshHierarchy(const Drawable& d) {
    for (auto& mesh : d.models) {
        if (!mesh.hasVertices() || !mesh.hasIndices())
            return false;
        if (!mesh.boneMap.empty() && !validBoneMapping(mesh.boneMap))
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

📦 3. Bounding Box & Sphere Verification

LOD switching and culling depend on correct bounds.

Check AABB Presence:

minBounds and maxBounds must be defined per model and for entire drawable.

Bounds Sanity Check:

No NaNs, infs, or min > max.

Model bounds should be within drawable bounds (not e.g., at (0,0,0) when mesh is at (1000,1000,1000)).

Sphere Consistency: Bounding sphere radius must enclose AABB or raise a warning.

cpp
bool validateBoundingBox(const AABB& box) {
    return box.min.x <= box.max.x &&
           box.min.y <= box.max.y &&
           box.min.z <= box.max.z;
}

🧮 4. LOD Validation

Ensure all Level-of-Detail stages are coherent.

LOD Count: Must have at least one (often three: High/Mid/Low).

Distance Thresholds: Ensure lodDistance increases with lower detail level.

LOD Mesh Assignment: Each LOD must include its own drawable model(s).

Unique Mesh IDs per LOD to avoid reusing mesh pointers across LODs (leads to flickering).

Highest LOD must contain full detail geometry (e.g., full head geometry in gore mods).

cpp
bool validateLods(const Drawable& d) {
    float lastDist = 0.0f;
    for (auto& lod : d.lods) {
        if (lod.distance <= lastDist) return false;
        if (lod.models.empty()) return false;
        lastDist = lod.distance;
    }
    return true;
}

🧬 5. Embedded Metadata Audits

Verify critical embedded structures.

Shaders and Materials:

At least one material per mesh.

No undefined shader hashes.

All material parameters must resolve (e.g., no missing textures or unknown types).

Vertex Declarations:

No unknown vertex formats (must match GTA V expected declarations).

Skeleton Presence (if animated):

Must include BoneNames, BoneTransforms, and matching skin weights.

Drawable Flags:

Check for unexpected flags like 0xFFFFFFFF or invalid combinations.

Unknown Chunk Warning: Raise logs for unknown embedded chunk IDs.

🧪 6. Optional Advanced Checks

Used for mods with precision animation or damage:

Bone Influence per Vertex:

Ensure vertex skinning uses <= 4 bones per vertex.

Alpha Sorting:

Detect meshes using transparency without sort flags — log potential draw order bugs.

Texture Format Validation:

Check DDS/embedded texture headers for DXT1/3/5 or BC7.

Log if using deprecated formats.

🧾 Output Format

Every .ydr processed returns a full JSON diagnostic result, like:

json
{
  "filename": "headburst.ydr",
  "status": "valid",
  "issues": [],
  "lods": 3,
  "mesh_count": 12,
  "bounding_box": {
    "valid": true,
    "min": [-0.1, -0.2, -0.3],
    "max": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
  },
  "bone_count": 27,
  "flags": {
    "hasSkeleton": true,
    "usesTransparency": false
  }
}

🛠️ Recommended Tools to Implement

C++ with OpenIV-compatible structures or CodeWalkerLib.

Alternative: gtaUtil, ydrparser, or build internal tool using Rockstar RSC file spec.

Consider using ImGui overlay to live preview validation.
