MODGPT: Feedback Intake System Design (v1.0)
Objective:
To enable the CEO to flag errors, prioritize critical tasks, and redirect swarm focus using simple commands, instantly altering MODGPT’s behavior and swarm trajectory.

🧠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Name: FEEDFORCE
Type: Real-time feedback and priority intake system
Role: Converts CEO’s simple error reports or commands into swarm re-prioritization, task injection, or urgent overrides.

🛠️ CORE COMPONENTS
1. Input Layer: CEO Feedback Command Interface

Accepts natural language or structured flags.

Supports both typed commands and drag-and-drop errors, e.g. dropped .asi, .zip, or logs.

Examples of valid CEO commands:

flag bug: build failed to check SDK version

priority+ debug memory leaks

block low-priority swarm #12

reroute swarm focus to test asi prebuild

!error bug #0131 misdiagnosed

!inject fix: verify src zip integrity on all trusted builds

freeze swarm until report #31 is addressed

2. Parser Layer: Feedback Interpreter

Translates CEO input into structured directives:

json
{
  "action": "flag",
  "target": "build pipeline",
  "issue": "SDK version not checked",
  "urgency": "critical",
  "result": "reroute 3 swarms to fix"
}

3. Swarm Update Dispatcher

Notifies relevant GPT intern swarms.

Updates the internal SwarmPriorityIndex (SPI) with new weights.

Can:

Inject new tasks

Modify existing ones

Freeze/disable non-critical ones

Override scheduled work

4. SwarmPriorityIndex (SPI)

Each swarm task gets a dynamic priority score (0–100).
CEO flags can:

Add priority points (+10 to +100)

Demote or disable tasks

Set "fire-alarm" triggers (e.g., error marked "urgent" bumps all swarm priorities related to that system class)

Lock mission-critical paths until validated

5. Feedback Logbook + Audit Trail

Every CEO command:

Stored in permanent audit (CEODIRECT.log)

Time-stamped and hash-locked for traceability

Triggers an internal "confirmation ping" once swarm reprioritization completes

🚨 CEO COMMAND SYNTAX GUIDE
Command Type	Syntax Example
🐛 Flag Error	flag bug: swarm misclassified dependency
🔥 Raise Priority	priority+ build trust check system
🧊 Freeze	freeze swarm #18 until log #241 resolved
⛔ Disable	disable swarm preflight.linter until review
🧠 Reroute Focus	reroute: shift 50% of swarm power to crash decoder
⚙️ Inject Logic	inject fix: require manifest scan before trusted? returns true
🧼 Cleanup	purge: delete all failed logs older than 5 builds
🔍 Verify Order	verify task queue: ensure all SDKs match HEAD
📌 Lock Feature	lock: prevent any test asi changes until #013 audit passes
⚡ SAMPLE USE CASE

Input:

plaintext
flag bug: test asi missing PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND native in .h
priority+ crash fix swarm
reroute swarm to enforce native validation prebuild


System Result:

All test asi logic swarms reprioritized to fix native declarations.

Swarm #test_asi_validation, Swarm #natives_inspector, and Swarm #sdk_linker jump from SPI 45 → 95.

All dependent build commands now invoke pre-build validation.

Feedback logged, swarm status updated, confirmation sent to CEO.

🧩 EXTENSIBILITY

Accepts attachments (logs, .asi, .zip) for auto-flagging by hash.

Future plan: Allow CEO to "label" swarms for faster flag routing:

label: memory profiler -> perf_watchdog

Then use flag bug in memory profiler shorthand.

✅ TASK COMPLETE CONFIRMATION

Every CEO flag gets:

🟢 Completed / 🟡 Pending / 🔴 Blocked state

Confirmation in a running CEO_FEEDBACK_DASH.log

Optionally: visual board of flagged commands and swarm response latency

✅ ETA FOR INTEGRATION (MODGPT LIVE)

🏗 Swarm Injection Hook: Live now

🔗 Parser System: ETA 1 swarm cycle

📡 Feedback Routing: ETA 2 swarm cycles

⏱ Real-time Confirmation & Dashboard: ETA 4 swarm cycles

Would you like me to begin implementation under SWARM_FEEDBACK_INTAKE.cmd, or do you want to adjust the command syntax first?
