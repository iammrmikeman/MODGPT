Explain how MODGPT should determine whether a native function is valid, deprecated, or dangerous in the current SDK.

**ChatGPT:**

To ensure the MODGPT system can correctly determine whether a native function is valid, deprecated, or dangerous, a rigorous multi-stage analysis process must be implemented. Below is a modular design for such a system, suitable for swarm parallelization and GPT self-validation:

üß† MODGPT Native Function Risk Assessment System
‚úÖ 1. Validation Layer ‚Äì Syntax & Declaration Checks

Purpose: Ensure that the native function exists, is syntactically correct, and matches current SDK definitions.

Checks:

Function exists in the latest natives.h or equivalent manifest.

Correct signature (return type + parameter types).

Corresponding opcode and hash are present in the SDK or official native DB.

Linked with .lib or .dll symbols if required (e.g., via ScriptHookV.lib).

GPT Actions:

Parse all SDK headers (*.h) to index known natives.

Auto-verify linkage feasibility using known extern "C" mappings or disassembly if .lib present.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Deprecation Layer ‚Äì Evolution and Redundancy Detection

Purpose: Identify if a native is deprecated, redundant, or superseded.

Sources:

Compare across multiple SDK versions (historical diffing).

Rockstar update logs (if scraped or community-archived).

GTA Native databases (e.g., https://nativedb.dotindustries.dev/ or https://alloc8or.re/gta5/nativedb/).

Checks:

Removed or renamed in newer SDKs.

Flagged as unstable in community sources (e.g., GTAF modding forums).

Functionality covered better by newer natives.

Known to no longer function post-game update (frequent in multiplayer patch cycles).

GPT Actions:

Maintain historical native evolution timeline.

Label each native with stable, deprecated, removed, unstable, or unknown.

Use AI-powered changelog diffing for preemptive deprecation predictions.

‚ò†Ô∏è 3. Danger Layer ‚Äì Crash Potential & Game-State Risk

Purpose: Flag natives that may:

Crash the game

Trigger anti-cheat (in Online modes)

Modify game-critical states (e.g., memory corruption, file system, player model)

Indicators of Dangerous Natives:

Functions that manipulate pointers (*_PTR, MEM_*, etc.).

Low-level system manipulation (e.g., WRITE_MEMORY, SHUTDOWN_LOADING_SCREEN).

Trigger known crashes when improperly sequenced (documented in community).

Use in Online mode triggers bans/kicks (e.g., altering money, network events).

GPT Actions:

Maintain an internal ‚Äúcrash catalog‚Äù sourced from:

Crash dumps

Forum reports

Known dangerous natives list (community-curated)

Mark these with CRITICAL_RISK, HIGH_RISK, MODERATE_RISK, SAFE.

Attach usage guidelines per native (e.g., "Only safe during loading screen").

üß™ 4. Behavioral Verification Layer ‚Äì In-Game Testing

Purpose: Dynamically confirm behavior, return types, and effects of a native via test plugins.

Tests:

Compile .asi test cases to invoke and monitor:

Return values

Game stability post-call

Visual/audio feedback

Runtime performance

Automation:

Use MODGPT test harness to sandbox:

Call each native with safe dummy data

Monitor screen, audio, memory delta, frame delay

Log results to feedback tracker

üì¶ 5. Tagging & Metadata System

Every native should be classified using this schema:

json
{
  "name": "SET_PLAYER_HEALTH_RECHARGE_MULTIPLIER",
  "status": "valid",
  "deprecation": "none",
  "risk": "low",
  "sdk_versions": ["1.0.617.1a", "1.0.877.1", "1.0.3521.0"],
  "aliases": ["_SET_PLAYER_HEALTH_RECHARGE_MULTIPLIER"],
  "notes": "Safe to use in single-player. Deprecated in FiveM.",
  "risk_reason": null,
  "test_result": {
    "crash": false,
    "fps_impact": "none",
    "runtime_log": "executed successfully"
  }
}

üîÅ 6. Continuous Swarm Update Protocol

Periodically run a swarm that:

Re-scrapes native databases

Audits .lib exports

Regenerates test coverage

Updates status flags

Reports discrepancies with changelogs

üß© Bonus: Custom Risk Profile Overlays for Each Mod

MODGPT should contextually filter native function trust based on:

Whether the mod is in-game only or menu-based

If it runs at startup or in mission context

Whether it targets SP or MP

CEO's risk tolerance (strict, experimental, sandbox, etc.)

Would you like this logic bundled into a .cmd swarm script for tonight‚Äôs SleepSwarm? Or should I integrate it into a plugin that flags suspicious natives during build validation?
