**ChatGPT:**

To optimize memory usage and per-frame native call overhead in the HeadShotV mod runtime, here is a detailed strategy broken into three categories:

üîç PHASE 1: Profiling Native Call Overhead (Per-Frame)
‚úÖ 1. Native Call Timing Profiler

Create a micro-profiler that runs per-frame, logging duration (in microseconds) of each native call:

cpp
LARGE_INTEGER start, end;
QueryPerformanceCounter(&start);
DRAW_RECT(...);
QueryPerformanceCounter(&end);
double duration = (end.QuadPart - start.QuadPart) * 1000000.0 / frequency.QuadPart;


Log into a ring buffer (std::deque) with a fixed size (e.g., 256 frames) to avoid memory bloat.

Automatically report the slowest native calls with tags (DRAW_RECT@overlay, IS_PED_SHOOTING@targetcheck, etc.).

‚úÖ 2. Native Call Count Tracker

Track how often each native is called per frame:

cpp
std::unordered_map<Hash, int> nativeCallCount;
nativeCallCount[GET_HASH_KEY("DRAW_RECT")] += 1;


Use this data to:

Spot accidental multiple calls (e.g., unnecessary IS_ENTITY_DEAD checks).

Flag overused or redundant natives.

‚úÖ 3. Frame Impact Heatmap (optional overlay)

Visualize CPU cost of sections:

Green: negligible

Yellow: moderate

Red: heavy (often loops or bad logic)
Use this to prioritize rewriting slow loops or delayed conditions.

üß† PHASE 2: Reducing Native Call Overhead
‚úÖ 4. Cache Native Results Temporarily

If the result of a native won't change within the same frame or during a short window:

cpp
static bool wasAiming = false;
static DWORD lastChecked = 0;

if (GetTickCount() - lastChecked > 5) {
   wasAiming = IS_PLAYER_FREE_AIMING(playerId);
   lastChecked = GetTickCount();
}


Apply this to:

Aiming

Ped state

Health

Wanted level

‚úÖ 5. Avoid Rechecking Unchanged Entities

Instead of checking every ped every frame, mark peds that:

Are already dead

Were flagged as irrelevant last check

Are too far (cache their distance squared from player)

cpp
struct TrackedPed {
  Ped ped;
  Vector3 lastKnownPos;
  bool shouldSkip;
};

‚úÖ 6. Inline Native Logic for Simple Checks

Where possible, replace natives with local computation:

Replace GET_DISTANCE_BETWEEN_COORDS with squared math.

Replace IS_PED_SHOOTING with weapon state flag if already monitored.

üíæ PHASE 3: Memory Usage Optimization
‚úÖ 7. Use Pool Allocators for High-Frequency Objects

Avoid per-frame new/delete:

cpp
ObjectPool<HitData, 128> hitDataPool;
HitData* h = hitDataPool.allocate();


Especially for:

Shot result containers

Target state records

Frame-specific debug overlays

‚úÖ 8. Reuse Overlay/UI Buffers

Don't recreate overlays each frame. Store:

Precomputed DRAW_RECT vertex data

Cached screen coordinates

Hit markers or debug lines

‚úÖ 9. Compress Runtime Logs in Memory

If you're tracking hit/miss data:

Use bitfields or structs with packed layout

Store only diffs from last frame where possible

‚úÖ 10. Static Buffers for Raycasts

Avoid per-frame allocation for:

cpp
RaycastResult ray;
static RaycastResult cachedRay;


Consider pooling raycasts with their targets to skip memory pressure.

üß™ Final Tool: HSV_Optimizer_Report()

Build a runtime dev command that shows:

Native call count per frame (top 10)

Total native time in ¬µs per frame

Number of tracked entities

Estimated RAM use (debug)

Warnings on excessive allocs or missed cache opportunities
