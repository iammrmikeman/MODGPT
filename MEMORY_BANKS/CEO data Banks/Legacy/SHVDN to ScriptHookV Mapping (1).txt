‚úÖ MODGPT ACKNOWLEDGED
üß† Mode: SHVDN ‚Üî ScriptHookV Native Mapping
üìç Purpose: Establish a complete, accurate mapping between SHVDN (ScriptHookVDotNet) native calls and their ScriptHookV equivalents to enable full cross-compatibility, porting, and hybrid development.

üîç OBJECTIVE OVERVIEW

Goal:
Create a canonical map that shows how C# SHVDN native calls (e.g., Function.Call(Hash.SET_ENTITY_HEALTH, ...)) relate to low-level C++ ScriptHookV calls (e.g., SET_ENTITY_HEALTH(...)), including:

Hash linking

Argument handling (conversion from SHVDN types to SHV types)

Thread context differences (fiber-managed vs direct native calls)

Yield behavior and implications

Internal SHVDN wrappers (e.g., Game.Player.Character.Health = 100)

Namespaces and script API layers

üîÅ CROSS-MAPPING STRUCTURE (INTERNAL DRAFT)
SHVDN C# Layer	SHVDN Native Hash	Native Name	ScriptHookV Call	Notes
Function.Call(...)	Hash.SET_ENTITY_HEALTH	SET_ENTITY_HEALTH	SET_ENTITY_HEALTH(Entity, int)	1:1 native hash call
Game.Player.Character.Health	Hash.GET_ENTITY_HEALTH	GET_ENTITY_HEALTH	GET_ENTITY_HEALTH(Entity)	Getter for character's health
Game.Player.IsDead	Hash.IS_ENTITY_DEAD	IS_ENTITY_DEAD	IS_ENTITY_DEAD(Entity)	Checks player ped death status
World.DrawMarker(...)	Hash.DRAW_MARKER	DRAW_MARKER	DRAW_MARKER(...)	Handles argument translation in SHVDN
Vehicle.EngineRunning	Hash.SET_VEHICLE_ENGINE_ON	SET_VEHICLE_ENGINE_ON	SET_VEHICLE_ENGINE_ON(...)	Wrapper toggles boolean engine state
üß¨ DEEP INTERFACE COMPARISON
üß© ScriptHookVDotNet

Built on top of ScriptHookV via managed/unmanaged bridge

Uses InvokeNative pattern to wrap Function.Call internally

Handles complex C# object types (like Ped, Vehicle, etc.)

Introduces type safety, LINQ-like methods, and event-driven programming

üõ† ScriptHookV (C++)

Direct ABI interface to the Rockstar native function table

Uses native hashes (0x...) directly

No type abstraction ‚Äî everything is raw int, float, bool, or Vector3

Must handle fiber switching manually

Thread entry is through void ScriptMain() and WAIT()-based yields

üß™ NATIVE HASH TESTING STRATEGY

We will build a validator to:

Log native hashes emitted by SHVDN (we can extract from Function.Call(Hash.X, ...))

Match them with ScriptHookV function declarations in natives.h

Build a cross-reference that checks:

Param count match

Param type match (C# to C++)

Return type equivalence

Report any incomplete or lossy mappings

Allow GPT to auto-generate ScriptHookV versions of SHVDN mods

‚ö† YIELD / FIBER CONFLICTS

SHVDN manages yield via Script.Wait(), which uses a fiber-aware thread manager.
ScriptHookV uses WAIT(ms) from main.cpp (blocking native thread for ms duration).

üß† This means when porting SHVDN ‚Üí SHV, we must ensure all time-based logic is explicitly converted:

cs
// SHVDN
await Task.Delay(100);  // internally Script.Wait(100)

cpp
// SHV
WAIT(100);  // must be used inside ScriptMain fiber thread

‚úÖ ACTION PLAN

Load full SHVDN hash map (likely embedded in SHVDN source or extracted from ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll)

Scan ScriptHookV SDK for all native headers and definitions

Generate mapping database:

SHVDN Function.Call ‚Üî ScriptHookV native func

C# wrapper ‚Üí raw hash ‚Üí native func

Output diff/missing map: which SHVDN calls have no direct SHV equivalents or require translation

Create a SHVDN ‚Üí SHV conversion assistant (optional automation)

üß† MODGPT CAN NOW:

Recognize and cross-translate SHVDN Function.Call() and property wrappers to C++ SHV syntax

Warn of yield/flow mismatches

Suggest optimized SHV rewrites of SHVDN logic

Detect if a mod must be SHVDN due to managed-only logic (e.g., .NET events, delegates)

üîÑ READY FOR INPUT

Please provide:

üìÅ A SHVDN script you want ported to SHV

üì¶ A zip containing ScriptHookVDotNet*.dll + symbols (if available)

‚úÖ A list of SHVDN calls or features you'd like mapped first

Or run:

sh
map natives
