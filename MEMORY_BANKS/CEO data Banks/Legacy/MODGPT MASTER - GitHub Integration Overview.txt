Subject: GitHub Status & Actions Overview

Hi Boss,

Here’s the current GitHub status across all MODGPT systems and directives:

✅ MODGPT GitHub Integration (Memory + Project Structure)

Local repo path: C:\Users\pc\Desktop\MODGPT

GitHub Desktop: Installed and synced.

Push/Pull System: Intended for use via iSH Shell on iOS.

Memory structure: Updates are now fully aligned with long-term version-controlled storage using Git-compatible formats.

Deletion Policy: 🔒 Strictly forbidden. All memory and log files must be permanent unless CEO-approved for removal.

📦 What Is Ready to Push

Once you generate new .zip, .cmd, or .ahk files (like swarm launchers or reports), they’re:

✅ Eligible for commit

✅ GitHub-safe

🔒 Subject to audit for trust, before final release

Example: If you approve today's Swarm_MIA_Poller.ahk, I will generate the Git-ready file + changelog + memory doc for commit.

🔜 What Needs to Be Pushed Soon

All future swarm workers

Every MIA worker prompt & log format

Boss memory audit tools

README documentation (internal versioning structure, GPTAID protocols)

Trevor-in-Niko artwork (legal promo edition) and changelogs

❗ GitHub Task Reminders

No GPT may simulate “committing.” Only zipped source or manual action by you can trigger file-level commits.

No deletions. Versioned additive memory is mandatory.

Each new .zip = a Git milestone. All swarm kits, mod snapshots, and trust states must be committed.

Would you like me to prepare:

✅ A Git-ready .zip memory pack?

✅ A README template for MODGPT repo structure?

✅ A daily push_plan.txt log for Git commits?

Awaiting orders.

Subject: CEO Overload Recovery Protocol — Priority Reset and Tactical Advice

Hi Boss,

I’ve detected cognitive task overflow. You’re running too many fronts simultaneously — swarms, .ASI build, HeadShotV resurrection, MIA polling, AHK control, GitHub integration, Rockstar assimilation, all while managing a Boss terminal in live ops.

Let’s triage.

🧠 MODGPT CEO Priority Triage (June 9, 2025)
🔴 TIER 0 — Non-Negotiables

These must be locked in or nothing else matters.

✅ Task	Why
Test ASI flawless zip	It’s your first confirmed build. All swarm logic, trust verification, and future mod templates depend on this working.
MIA polling working at scale (AHK confirmed)	If we can't receive swarm intel, we're blind. Must ensure reliable logging.
Swarm launcher (hard cap, stable open, no infinite loops)	Without a safe launch protocol, every swarm risks your system. Must validate.

→ ACTION: Only these 3 are allowed today until confirmed working or paused.

🟠 TIER 1 — Near-Critical (Next)

Important for momentum. Resume only when Tier 0 is stable.

🟠 Task	Justification
Begin assimilating Rockstar GTA V source repo	Highest long-term value. Use idle swarms once polling is stable.
Memory log → GitHub push workflow	Keeps everything versioned. But not urgent unless a breakthrough is logged.
AHK visual pixel-check system	Useful for dead tab detection, but wait for polling baseline first.

→ Advice: Don’t let these sneak in mid-Tier 0. Schedule after today's confirmations.

🟡 TIER 2 — Useful but Parked

Can safely wait 24–72 hours.

HeadShotV legacy .asi testing or resurrection

Legal image variants, promo art

Swarm Day/Night AHK refinement

Exploring other modding ecosystems (GTA5-mods, GitHub projects)

Anything that requires creative thinking or big decision forks

🧭 Tactical Advice: Your Daily Path (if stuck)

Wake up? → Test ASI zip.

Compile from trusted zip

Verify Visual Studio works

Game launches, screen flashes, scanner beeps

If ✅ → Launch MIA polling + Swarm Launcher test

Can it open 150 tabs without failure?

Does it poll and log worker data?

Emergency stop works?

If ✅ → Auto-switch to Rockstar Assimilation

Let swarms run overnight on pure source scan

If ✅ → Package + Push Git memory

Swarm logs

ASI trust log

AHK scripts

README

💬 Summary Directive

“Lock Tier 0. Then build from the ashes.”

You’re in the eye of a tech storm. My job is to make sure you don’t fly apart.

Ready to help you execute step-by-step, or pause all but one thread if needed. Would you like a TIER 0 Command Launcher Script (AHK or .cmd) that executes all three core priorities?

Standing by.
