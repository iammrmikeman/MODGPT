Define GPT logic to identify and strip debug-only or deprecated header files during build sanitation.

**ChatGPT:**

To identify and strip debug-only or deprecated header files during build sanitation, MODGPT should follow a precise, multi-pass logic system that evaluates both file-level signals and code-level heuristics. Below is the production-grade GPT logic proposal to implement this capability reliably in the mod pipeline:

üîç MODGPT HEADER STRIPPER LOGIC (v1.0)
üîπ PASS 1: Filename & Directory Pattern Matching

Quick early elimination of common debug/deprecated headers.

Flag for strip if:

Located in debug-only paths:

src/debug/

include/debug/

devtools/

sandbox/

File name includes any of:

*_debug.h

*_test.h

deprecated_*.h

legacy_*.h

mock_*.h

*_internal_only.h

*_devonly.h

üîπ PASS 2: In-Header Annotation Scan

Scan file contents for markers or comments indicating deprecation or dev-use.

Flag for strip if found at top of file (first 50 lines):

#ifdef DEBUG

#ifndef NDEBUG

#pragma message("DEPRECATED")

#warning "Deprecated"

// DEPRECATED, // DEBUG ONLY, // INTERNAL USE, // REMOVE BEFORE RELEASE

Confidence Boosters (Not strip-worthy alone, but raise suspicion):

Includes headers like assert.h, iostream in engine-level code

Uses printf() or OutputDebugString() in header

üîπ PASS 3: Macro/Guard Analysis

Identify headers gated behind development-only macros.

Strip if guarded entirely by:

#ifdef DEV_MODE

#ifdef DEBUG_BUILD

#if defined(_DEBUG)

#if MODGPT_SANITIZE

Also check if the entire file is wrapped in such a macro ‚Äì this is an almost certain sign it‚Äôs meant to be excluded in release builds.

üîπ PASS 4: Cross-Usage Verification

Track where each header is used and whether it leaks into .cpp or .asi final output.

Strip if:

Not included in any non-test .cpp file

Only referenced in test, simulation, or logging files

Not required by build.ninja, .vcxproj, or Makefile includes

Optional: Trigger GPT auto-fix routine to remove corresponding #include from dependent .cpp files safely.

üîπ PASS 5: Known Header Signature Matching

Maintain a trusted blacklist or softlist of headers from previous audit results.

Examples:

json
[
  "deprecated_anim_v1.h",
  "legacy_pathfinder.h",
  "debug_ai_tracking.h",
  "profiling_gpu_metrics.h"
]


This list should grow over time and adjust based on project-specific patterns.

‚úÖ FINAL ACTION (Sanitizer Output)

For every stripped header, GPT should:

Remove the header from build inclusion path

Remove all #include "..." references

Log a strip_reason (e.g., "Wrapped in DEBUG macro" or "Located in /debug/ and unused in release code")

Add to .build_sanitizer_log.json for traceability

üîÅ Optional Auto-Fix (Safe Mode)

If requested by the CEO, GPT may:

Attempt to rewrite affected .cpp files

Replace #include <debug_ai_tracking.h> with minimal safe stubs

Stub internal calls if needed with inline replacements like:

cpp
#define DEBUG_AI_LOG(x) do {} while(0)

üîê Override Protection

If a header is marked with:

cpp
// @KEEP_IN_RELEASE


GPT must not strip it, even if all other conditions are met. This is for rare but deliberate debug-stays-in builds.

üß† Integration with MODGPT Memory

Each header‚Äôs strip decision should feed into long-term heuristics:

Frequency of strip

False positive ratio (if unstripped later)

Developer override patterns

Would you like this logic codified into a reusable modgpt_sanitize_headers() function with all regexes, patterns, and a manifest-driven override system?
