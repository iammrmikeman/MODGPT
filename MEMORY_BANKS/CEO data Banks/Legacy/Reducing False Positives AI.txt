**ChatGPT:**

To reduce false positives in AI aim registration for the HeadShotV mod (i.e., mistakenly detecting a headshot when the AI didn't actually aim or hit the head), we must tighten the logic used to detect both intent and precision of NPC fire. Here's a breakdown of robust, production-grade methods to accomplish this:

üîç 1. Precise Bone Hit Validation

Problem: Current checks may accept nearby hits as valid.

Solution:

Use GET_PED_LAST_DAMAGE_BONE and validate that it returns SKEL_Head (0x796E).

Cross-check against:

GET_PED_BONE_COORDS(ped, SKEL_Head, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

HAS_ENTITY_BEEN_DAMAGED_BY_ENTITY

Introduce a distance threshold: ensure bullet impact is within ~5cm of the head origin.

üß† 2. Line-of-Sight Ray Confirmation

Problem: AI may shoot from behind walls or fire wildly.

Solution:

Cast a ray from the AI‚Äôs weapon muzzle to the player‚Äôs head bone.

cpp
SHAPE::START_EXPENSIVE_SYNCHRONOUS_SHAPE_TEST_LOS_PROBE(...)


Only register a headshot if ray hits the head bone directly without obstruction.

üéØ 3. Aim Cone Accuracy

Problem: AI sometimes fires without precise aim yet gets credited.

Solution:

Measure the angular deviation between:

Vector(AI forward vector) ‚Üí Vector(to player's head).

Require the angle to be <5¬∞ for it to be considered a "true" aimed shot.

‚è± 4. Temporal Correlation (Shot Timing)

Problem: Damage may occur late due to physics lag or projectile delay.

Solution:

Timestamp each AI shot with GET_GAME_TIMER().

Only accept a headshot if:

It occurs within a 150ms window after the AI fired AND

No other damage source intervened (e.g., explosion, car).

üï∂ 5. Weapon Type Sanity Check

Problem: False positives triggered by melee, explosions, or AI ramming.

Solution:

Filter out headshots caused by:

Melee weapons (check WEAPON_TYPE_GROUP)

Explosive projectiles

Vehicles

Use:

cpp
WEAPON::GET_CURRENT_PED_WEAPON(...)
WEAPON::IS_PED_ARMED(ped, flags)

üë• 6. Friendly Fire and Crowd Check

Problem: AI in a crowd may shoot by accident.

Solution:

If multiple Peds are near the player, ensure:

The shooter has target lock on the player (IS_PED_TRACKED)

No other closer Peds were hit before the player

üì∏ 7. Visual Confirm (Advanced Option)

Optional for deeper debugging:

Log or render a brief impact marker (e.g., debug sphere on SKEL_Head hit).

Save logs only for edge-case events (false positives suspected).

üß™ 8. False Positive Testing Suite

Create synthetic test cases:

AI shooting above, beside, behind player

AI blind-firing or reacting to noise

Shots blocked by glass or fence

Log all hits and audit:

Angle of shot

Distance to bone

Ray result

Weapon used

‚úÖ Summary of Key Checks to Chain
cpp
if (HAS_ENTITY_BEEN_DAMAGED_BY_ENTITY(player, npc, true) &&
    GET_PED_LAST_DAMAGE_BONE(player, &bone) && bone == SKEL_Head &&
    IS_PED_SHOOTING(npc) &&
    !IS_ENTITY_OCCLUDED(player) &&
    IsRayClear(npc, player_head_coords) &&
    AngleBetweenVectors(npc_aim_vector, head_vector) < 5.0f &&
    TimeSinceShot(npc) < 150ms &&
    IsWeaponValid(npc_weapon))
{
    RegisterTrueHeadshot();
}


Would you like me to build a live visual debug overlay for this logic or propose test-case scripts to simulate and record AI firing behavior?
