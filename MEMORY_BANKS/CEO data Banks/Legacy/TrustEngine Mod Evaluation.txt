✅ GTAV MODGPT: Recursive Trust Rating Engine Initialization
Status: BOOTSTRAP MODE
Version: TrustEngine v0.01-alpha
Scope: .zip + .asi + manifest + mod integrity + GPT memory compliance

🔧 Primary Objective

Build a self-evolving trust engine that continuously ranks mods and zipped packages based on risk, trustworthiness, and build readiness — recursive across multiple generations of builds and updates.

🧠 DESIGN: TrustEngine v0.01-alpha
🔁 Core Principle: Recursive Verification

Each mod/zip is scored, tagged, and validated using data extracted from:

File structure

Manifest presence and accuracy

Build history & GPT decisions

Known SDK/API references

Placeholder/pseudocode detection

Signature of user or system tampering

Past failure lineage (recursive trust decay)

📊 TRUST SCORE MODEL (0 to 100)
Metric Category	Weight	Description
📁 File Completeness	20	All expected files present? Structure valid?
📜 Manifest Integrity	15	Does manifest exist? Accurate metadata?
🔍 Placeholder Detection	15	Are any files stubs, TODOs, pseudocode, or mock logic?
🧬 Source Authenticity	10	Origin of .zip — GPT build, manual upload, legacy copy?
🔄 GPT Decision Trust	10	Was this build deemed trusted by GPT previously?
💥 Runtime Crash Risk	10	Has this mod ever caused crashes? Infinite loops?
🧷 SHV/SHVDN API Use	10	Correct, safe, and valid usage of ScriptHookV natives?
🔁 Recursive Score Trace	10	Trust score of parent zip if mod is evolved
✅ TRUST RATING TIERS
Score Range	Trust Rating	Meaning
90–100	🔵 TRUSTED	Safe for build, test, and integration
75–89	🟢 HIGH	Likely good, minor validation needed
50–74	🟡 MEDIUM	Needs deeper inspection
25–49	🔴 LOW	Incomplete, unsafe, or questionable
0–24	⚫ UNTRUSTED	Critical errors, unsafe to build
🔄 RECURSIVE LOGIC CHAIN

Every zip is hashed and assigned a unique mod lineage ID. Trust score will:

Inherit decay/bonus from parent zips.

Log reasons for scoring.

Flag suspicious anomalies (e.g. trusted build with placeholder code).

Be updateable upon re-evaluation.

🧪 TEST MODE (Simulated Until Trusted Source Available)

Running test on mock .zip with:

Partial structure

No manifest

Contains TODO comments in logic

📤 INPUT: test_mod_v1.zip
📥 OUTPUT:

Metric	Score
File Completeness	10/20
Manifest Integrity	0/15
Placeholder Detection	5/15
Source Authenticity	5/10
GPT Decision Trust	0/10
Runtime Crash Risk	5/10
SHV/SHVDN API Use	5/10
Recursive Score Trace	5/10
Total	35/100 = 🔴 LOW
🧩 NEXT STEPS

Would you like to:

🔍 Run it on a real uploaded zip or mod?

🧠 Enable memory storage of trust lineage per mod?

📂 Enforce auto-sorting of mods into TRUSTED / UNTRUSTED directories?

💣 Fail builds that don’t reach 75+ trust score by default?

🔁 Auto-trigger recursive re-evaluation on file changes?

All of the above can be installed into a permanent MODGPT subsystem.

Let me know which options to activate.
