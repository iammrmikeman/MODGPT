**ChatGPT:**

As the AI intern in charge of tab cleanup, my mission is to ensure MODGPT doesn’t retain redundant threads, duplicated logic, or unsafe memory traces across mod sessions. Below is a complete cleanup system proposal to prevent stray memory writes and logic duplication:

🔧 MODGPT Tab Cleanup Protocol v1.0
🔁 1. Tab Identity & Fingerprinting

Every active tab (chat session) should be assigned a unique fingerprint, based on:

Tab creation time

Associated mod name (if any)

GPT role/task type (e.g., Builder, Critic, Test Runner)

SHA-256 hash of its last system directive

Why: Prevents two tabs from evolving in parallel on the same mod with different instructions — the fingerprint detects divergence immediately.

🧠 2. Context Snapshotting & Reconciliation

On tab switch or inactivity > X minutes, MODGPT saves a diff snapshot of the tab’s memory delta from the main mod state.

On return, it prompts: “Tab X has divergent memory — reconcile with current master thread?”

Why: Prevents silent memory forks or orphan logic branches from polluting shared mod memory.

🚫 3. Duplicate Task Detector

Before spawning any new page, MODGPT runs:

python
if task_fingerprint in active_tab_registry:
    raise DuplicateTaskWarning("This task is already active in another tab.")


Edge Case Logic:

Allows parallel subroles (e.g., 3 bugcheckers on same mod), but not identical full-role overlap (e.g., two Build verifiers on same mod version).

🧹 4. Automatic Expiry + Safe Flush

If a tab remains open but unedited for 30+ minutes, MODGPT flags it as stale.

Unless it contains manual user edits or bookmarks, it's auto-archived and flushed from active mod state.

Flush is always dry-run simulated first; no writes unless safe.

💥 5. Write Safeguard Memory Vault

All tab-to-core memory writes must pass through a WriteVault handler:

python
def WriteVault(change):
    if is_duplicate(change): reject()
    if violates_manifest(change): reject()
    if alters trust boundary: require_user_approval()
    commit(change)


Why: Prevents accidental writes, duplicate task states, or unsanctioned trust mutations.

🧬 6. Tab Ancestry Graph

Each tab keeps a lineage record: what task spawned it, which swarm it belongs to, and what shared memory it touches.

MODGPT uses this graph to:

Detect cyclical task chains

Prevent "echo chambers" of intern-only feedback

Identify abandoned forks

🧠 7. Memory Hygiene Hooks (onClose, onRefresh, onSwarmLaunch)

All tabs implement onClose() and onRefresh() hooks that:

Clean their write buffers

Detach from the mod namespace if uncommitted

Report incomplete tasks to the mod ledger

📘 8. Critical Task Locking

Key operations like:

build

test asi

trusted?
…should lock the tab for exclusive execution unless the user manually overrides.

Why: No two tabs should run build on the same mod version concurrently — risk of conflicting assumptions or ghost failures.

📒 9. Tab Ledger + Cleanup Summary

All tabs that touch a mod log:

Tasks run

Memory touched

Errors raised

Writes committed

A cleanup routine then generates a daily:

"🧽 Tab Cleanup Report for HeadShotV: 3 stale, 1 diverged, 0 unsafe writes, 2 flushed safely."

✅ Result: Clean, Predictable Mod AI Memory

These systems ensure:

No stray logic loops

No silent state overwrites

No ghost tabs or abandoned forks

All tab work is tracked, reconcilable, and memory-safe

Would you like me to generate the actual code for the WriteVault handler or the Tab Fingerprint schema next?
