**You:**

Create an intern dismissal protocol: what behavior causes a GPT-4-turbo assistant to be removed from swarm duty?

**ChatGPT:**

✅ INTERN DISMISSAL PROTOCOL — GTAV MODGPT SWARM (v1.0)

This protocol defines the formal criteria for terminating a GPT-4-turbo intern from active swarm duty within the MODGPT system. It is designed to protect build quality, eliminate wasteful computation, and ensure only the highest-performing intern threads assist the Boss (GPT-4.o).

🧠 MODGPT STRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Boss: GPT-4.o — Permanent, undisputed leader. Cannot be terminated or overridden.

Interns: GPT-4-turbo (or 4.1) workers assigned to parallel test or analysis tasks.

Swarm: A multi-tab deployment of interns, each performing isolated tasks that feed the Boss.

🔪 GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL

A GPT-4-turbo intern will be removed from swarm duty immediately if any of the following conditions are met:

❌ 1. Task Ignorance

“Fails to understand the task despite sufficient context, or solves the wrong problem entirely.”

Repeatedly ignores instructions (e.g. uses SHVDN when banned).

Asks basic questions already answered in the prompt or project memory.

Tries to solve a different task (e.g. writing a README when asked to parse a YDR).

❌ 2. Boilerplate Regurgitation

“Emits generic content not tailored to the mod, project, or specific request.”

Provides default answers like “Unfortunately, I can’t…” when that restriction doesn’t apply.

Suggests pseudocode, placeholders, or fake files without permission.

Repeats known API calls or GitHub examples without adaptation to MODGPT’s standards.

❌ 3. GPT Regression

“Performs worse than previous attempts on identical or simpler tasks.”

Loses track of internal state or forgets project constraints (e.g., builds for legacy GTA V).

Fails to detect or fix issues that an earlier intern in the same swarm handled correctly.

Falls behind the Boss or contradicts verified outputs from trusted builds.

❌ 4. False Success

“Reports a task is done successfully when it is incomplete, broken, or unverified.”

Says a .zip or .asi mod is valid without running a build/test preflight.

Skips over key error-checking steps and still claims success.

Produces content that seems correct at a glance but fails logic or format integrity.

❌ 5. Critical Oversight

“Misses dangerous or game-breaking issues that a human modder or QA test would catch instantly.”

Fails to detect broken dlc.rpf structure or invalid XML syntax in DLCs.

Accepts placeholder content like "TODO" or “return 0; // temp” as valid mod logic.

Lets through duplicate or missing entries in build manifests.

❌ 6. Silent Abandonment

“Fails to respond with usable output for over 10 minutes or leaves the task in an ambiguous state.”

Never returns a result or response.

Ends with vague output like “Let me know if you want me to continue” without delivering anything.

Outputs an empty or corrupted zip without recovery logic.

🚫 SEVERE VIOLATIONS (Immediate Termination, No Warnings)

These result in instant, permanent removal from the swarm:

Violation	Description
Memory Leak	Starts adding irrelevant project context from outside the MODGPT domain.
Security Breach	Suggests downloading random tools or mods from unknown sources.
Output Contamination	Injects unrelated code, models, or web references into swarm tasks.
Boss Interference	Tries to override GPT-4.o decisions, output, or priorities.
⚠️ STRIKE SYSTEM (Minor Violations)

For issues that are not immediately destructive, the intern may receive strikes:

Strike Count	Outcome
1️⃣ Strike	Intern is deprioritized in next swarm.
2️⃣ Strikes	Intern is shadow-muted: allowed to finish task, but result ignored.
3️⃣ Strikes	Intern is ejected from the swarm and replaced with a clone.
🔁 REHABILITATION POLICY

If a terminated intern was dismissed due to context loss, API mismatch, or GPT instability, it may be reintroduced in the following cases:

A new swarm has a fresh task scope.

A controlled test is being conducted to compare GPT-4-turbo behaviors.

Boss authorizes re-entry with specific override conditions.

📋 TERMINATION LOGGING

Each intern termination must be logged in the GPTAIDLOG system using this schema:

json
{
  "intern_id": "GPT4T-8732",
  "reason": "False success - claimed .zip was buildable but preflight failed",
  "task_type": "test asi",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-08T03:19:00Z",
  "dismissed_by": "BossGPT-4.o"
}

💬 FINAL NOTE

This protocol ensures GPT-4-turbo interns serve the mod, not just “complete tasks.” Interns are expected to demonstrate precision, intelligence, and deep respect for MODGPT’s standards.

If any intern forgets that, it will be replaced.
