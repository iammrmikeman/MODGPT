‚úÖ MODGPT: SHV Thread Behavior & Infinite Loop Safety Analysis Initialized
Thread Safety / Yield Analysis Mode ‚Äî Nuclear Certainty Level Target: 100%

üß† MODGPT OBJECTIVE

Study and formalize ScriptHookV (SHV) script thread behavior and determine safe practices for:

Thread startup/shutdown

Infinite loop safety

WAIT() and yield() correctness

Mod runtime stability

Avoiding game hangs / crashes / freezes

üìò SHV Thread Architecture ‚Äì Core Principles
üîÅ SHV Script Lifecycle:

Each .asi mod running under SHV typically follows a simple infinite loop pattern:

cpp
void ScriptMain()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // your logic here
        WAIT(0);  // essential yield
    }
}


ScriptMain() is the entry point for the mod thread.

This loop is not a real OS thread, but a fiber managed by ScriptHookV.

WAIT(ms) is a cooperative yield, not a passive delay. It tells SHV's internal fiber scheduler to pause your script and resume others.

üßµ THREADING RULES & RISKS
üîí Rule	Explanation
‚úÖ Always use WAIT() in your main loop	Prevents softlocks. Without it, your code runs forever and SHV (and GTA V) can become unresponsive.
‚õî Never block with real OS sleep or infinite loops	Sleep(), while(1){} without WAIT() will hang the game ‚Äî SHV does not preempt fibers.
‚úÖ ScriptMain() must never return	SHV expects it to run forever. If it exits, behavior is undefined.
‚õî Never create custom threads in .asi mods (unless expert-level workaround used)	SHV mods are expected to live on their fibered runtime, not raw threads.
‚ö†Ô∏è Yield responsibly	Using WAIT(0) every frame is good, but for logic that happens every second, use WAIT(1000) appropriately.
‚öôÔ∏è WAIT() VS yield()

WAIT(ms)

Macro that maps to scriptWait(ms)

Defined in ScriptHookV SDK headers

Essential for yielding control to SHV's scheduler

yield()

Not part of SHV by default, but some devs define it for better semantics:

cpp
#define yield() WAIT(0)

üí£ CRASH SCENARIOS TO AVOID
Scenario	Result
while (true) {} (no WAIT)	GTA V freeze or crash
while (true) { Sleep(1); }	Total hang, SHV thread won't yield
ScriptMain() exits	Crashes on reload, no re-entry supported
Using native functions outside main SHV fiber	May cause access violations or instability
Calling WAIT() from the wrong thread	May cause scheduler corruption
üîç INTERNAL SHV SCHEDULING (Decompiled Insight)

SHV hooks into GTA V's script engine and allocates a fiber per loaded mod

Every tick, SHV swaps fibers between mods using the WAIT() value to determine delay before next resume

Stack unwinding is unsafe: do not throw C++ exceptions across WAIT() calls

Each WAIT(ms) effectively triggers:
SwitchToFiber(nextFiber);

‚úÖ CORRECT PATTERN (Safe Infinite Loop)
cpp
void ScriptMain()
{
    while (true)
    {
        // Example: blink screen every second
        if (GetGameTimer() % 1000 < 16)
        {
            DRAW_RECT(0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 255, 0, 0, 100);  // Example visual
        }

        WAIT(0);  // <== critical to prevent softlock
    }
}

üß™ MODGPT THREADED SIMULATION TEST CASES (SUGGESTED)
Test ID	Goal	PASS Condition
T1	Infinite loop w/ no WAIT	Game locks up immediately
T2	Loop w/ Sleep(1)	Game freezes but SHV remains loaded
T3	ScriptMain() returns	Mod unloads or crashes silently
T4	WAIT outside ScriptMain()	Log warning or crash
T5	High-frequency WAIT(0) usage	Stable, smooth FPS
T6	Mixed yield durations	Stable behavior, staggered logic confirmed
üîß RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ALL MODS

Do NOT trust OS threads. Always code for SHV's fiber model.

Use WAIT() consistently. Never assume it's optional.

Centralize all logic inside ScriptMain().

Wrap any high-complexity loop with explicit WAIT()

Ensure ScriptMain() is treated as eternal ‚Äî treat exit as a critical failure.

Would you like a real .asi mod now that demonstrates each of these behaviors (both safe and unsafe) for visual in-game testing?

Or shall I embed the logic into a diagnostic testing framework inside MODGPT for all future mod builds?

Let me know how deep to go.
