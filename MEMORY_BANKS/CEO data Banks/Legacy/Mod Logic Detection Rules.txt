**ChatGPT:**

Here is a high-confidence ruleset that can be deployed to detect incomplete logic, TODOs, placeholders, and boilerplate in mod .zip source files ‚Äî especially in the context of GTA V mods (like HeadShotV) using C++ and ScriptHookV SDKs.

üîé MODGPT INCOMPLETE LOGIC DETECTION RULES v1.0

These rules apply to source code, headers, build scripts, and config/manifest files inside .zip mod packages. Designed to halt or downgrade trust in mod builds if suspicious patterns are detected.

üõë HIGH-SEVERITY: Immediate Fail (Red Flag)

These patterns strongly indicate incomplete or non-functional logic and will automatically block the build.

1. TODO / FIXME / STUB

Regex:

regex
\b(TODO|FIXME|STUB|PLACEHOLDER|WIP)\b


Comments like // TODO: add logic or /* FIXME: not working */ are disallowed.

Applies to .cpp, .h, .ini, .txt, .md, and .xml.

2. Empty Function Bodies

Detects unimplemented code:

cpp
void MyFunction() { }
void MyFunction() {
    // TODO
}


Flags:

Empty function blocks (no logic, just open-close braces).

Function containing only return;, // TODO, or whitespace.

3. Empty Switch/Case or If-Else

Pattern:

cpp
switch (x) {
    case 1:
        break;
}


Or:

cpp
if (someCheck) {
    // no-op
}


‚Üí Considered suspicious if more than two in a row.

4. Boilerplate Licensing or Templates Unused

If a file only contains:

MIT/GPL license header

Default Unreal/Unity/VS file scaffold

Class declaration with no fields/methods

‚Üí Treat as boilerplate without logic unless referenced by other files.

‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM-SEVERITY: Suspicious (Yellow Flag)

These don‚Äôt automatically fail the build, but trigger review or warnings.

5. Default Return Values

Patterns like:

cpp
return 0;
return nullptr;
return true;


‚Üí Used without prior logic (e.g., in bool CheckIfHeadshot() { return true; })

6. Unreferenced Functions

Function is declared and defined, but:

Never called in any .cpp file

Never registered with ScriptHookV or any engine hooks

‚Üí May be a logic stub or orphaned concept.

7. Excessive Comments vs. Code

If comments are:

50% of file content

Describing logic that doesn‚Äôt actually exist yet

‚Üí Possibly planning but not yet implemented.

‚öôÔ∏è LOW-SEVERITY: Contextual Checks

These may indicate incomplete work if combined with other flags:

8. Suspicious File Names

Filenames like:

test.cpp, new.cpp, temp.h, feature_x_old.cpp

‚Üí Indicates temp or experimental logic.

9. Untouched Defaults

Files untouched from SDK templates:

ScriptHookV SDK‚Äôs main.cpp unmodified

INI with [Settings] section but no values

‚úÖ Auto-Pass Conditions

Avoid false positives by ensuring:

Functions are referenced by entry points (like Main() or OnTick())

All manifest fields (author, version, dependencies) are filled

Any ‚Äúdebug‚Äù or ‚Äútest‚Äù references are wrapped in #ifdef DEBUG or excluded from release

üß† Recommended Use in MODGPT

Each scanned .zip triggers the following:

Regex + AST scan across all code and manifest files

Red Flag = immediate fail and explain why

Yellow Flag = downgrade trust score

All findings logged in audit trail for traceability

Would you like these turned into a live checker module for integration into the verify? or build stages of MODGPT? I can generate the rule engine as a Python, C#, or C++ script ‚Äî or embed it as a GPT-internal logic filter.
