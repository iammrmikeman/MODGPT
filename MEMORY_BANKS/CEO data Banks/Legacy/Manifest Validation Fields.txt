**ChatGPT:**

As MODGPT‚Äôs Mod Manifest Enforcer, the following fields are mandatory for a manifest.json to qualify a GTA V mod as "trusted". These fields enable traceability, reproducibility, and diagnostic reliability across all builds and environments. Every trusted mod must include:

‚úÖ Mandatory Manifest Fields (Trusted Status)

Each field is shown with expected type and purpose.

1. "mod_id": string

A globally unique identifier for the mod across all builds (e.g. "com.headshotv.core").
Used for swarm tracking, logging, and version resolution.

2. "mod_name": string

Human-readable mod name (e.g. "HeadShotV").
Shown in dashboards, logs, and build reports.

3. "version": string

Strict semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-label] (e.g. "1.2.3" or "1.2.3-beta").
Used for regression tracking and upgrade rules.

4. "build_hash": string

A SHA256 hash of the entire build output (or source zip).
Must match GPT-calculated value for build to be trusted.

5. "source_archive": string

Filename of the trusted source archive used to produce this mod, e.g. "HeadShotV_1.2.3_src.zip"
Enables full reconstruction and rollback.

6. "entry_file": string

Main plugin or script entry point, e.g. "HeadShotV.asi" or "main.dll"
Used by loaders and mod runners to initialize the mod.

7. "mod_type": string

Declares core type: "asi", "dll", "rageplugin", "openiv", "shvdn", etc.
Used to select proper execution/testing mode.

8. "sdk_version": string

Version of SDK or API used to build mod (e.g., "ScriptHookV 1.0.617.1a").
Enforces compatibility during load or test.

9. "dependencies": array[string]

All external dependencies required to run (e.g., [ "ScriptHookV", "dinput8.dll" ])
Ensures test environments are prepped correctly.

10. "timestamp": string

UTC ISO 8601 format timestamp of last successful build.
E.g. "2025-06-07T23:12:05Z"
Supports trusted pipeline logging.

11. "author": string

The mod‚Äôs creator or internal developer handle (can be anonymized).
Used in trust scopes and behavioral fingerprinting.

12. "description": string

Short text summary (max ~200 chars). Helps with dashboard clarity and auto-documentation.

üîê Optional but Strongly Recommended Fields (Trusted+ Tier)
Field	Type	Purpose
"homepage"	string	Link to project repo, documentation, or info page
"signed"	boolean	Indicates if mod is cryptographically signed
"test_results"	object	Inline summary of latest automated test results
"tags"	array[string]	e.g., ["combat", "ai", "damage", "visual"] for search/sorting
"compatibility"	object	E.g., { "gta_version": "1.0.3095.0", "platform": "Enhanced" }
üß† Why These Fields?

These requirements enforce:

Full traceability (back to src zip and SDK)

Build integrity via hashes

Support for safe rollback

Clear versioning policies

Cross-system dependency resolution

Consistency across swarm agents and diagnostic tools

üîí Trusted Manifest = Gatekeeper

If any mandatory field is:

Missing

Malformed

Falsified

Inconsistent (e.g. hash mismatch)

‚Üí MODGPT must automatically reject the build or trigger a red alert audit.
