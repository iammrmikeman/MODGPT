**ChatGPT:**

To calculate trust/confidence in its own builds across hundreds of test scenarios, MODGPT should implement a layered Confidence Score Model (CSM) — a dynamic system that aggregates verification results, historical behavior, environmental variance, and anomaly detection into a single numerical trust score (0–100%) per build.

🔧 MODGPT Confidence Score Model (CSM) — Design v1.0
🧠 Overview:

MODGPT’s confidence in a build must reflect how likely it is that the mod will run correctly, safely, and as intended in GTA V Enhanced Edition. The score must evolve as testing expands and can never be falsified. If MODGPT is uncertain, it must admit so.

✅ STAGE 1: Build Integrity Pass (20% of total score)

These are binary or deterministic checks that confirm build correctness at the file/system level.

Subcheck	Description	Weight
MANIFEST_MATCH	Does the build’s output match the versioned manifest?	5%
NO_PLACEHOLDERS	Zero TODOs, stubs, or unimplemented logic?	5%
NO_WARNINGS	Was it compiled with zero warnings or unsafe casts?	5%
NO_BUILD_ERRORS	Fully successful build without patched scripts?	5%
✅ STAGE 2: Static Analysis Score (20%)

This involves deep inspection of code without executing it.

Subcheck	Description	Weight
NATIVE_SANITY	Are all ScriptHookV native calls declared, traced, and legal?	5%
DEPENDENCY_GRAPH	Are all .lib/.h/.cpp/.asi dependencies traceable and minimal?	5%
REDUNDANT_CODE	Are there unused headers or never-called functions?	5%
MEMORY_LEAK_PATTERNS	Are alloc/free patterns correctly balanced?	5%
✅ STAGE 3: Behavioral Testing Score (30%)

Dynamic analysis from simulation, trace logging, or emulation.

Subcheck	Description	Weight
LOAD_SUCCESS	Did the .asi load in SHV testbed (emulated or live)?	10%
TIMER_BEHAVIOR_MATCH	Does any scheduled behavior (e.g., 5s intervals) execute correctly?	5%
AUDIO OR VISUAL EFFECT VALIDATION	Was the screen flash or scanner beep rendered successfully?	10%
NO_CRASH_SIGNAL	No exceptions, thread crashes, or exit anomalies?	5%
✅ STAGE 4: Historical Model Trust (10%)

Leverages past learning to adjust confidence.

Subcheck	Description	Weight
CODEBASE STABILITY	Was this source code stable across past builds?	4%
INCREMENT SIZE	Was this build a small delta from a trusted one?	3%
NO REGRESSIONS	Does diff show no removed verified logic?	3%
✅ STAGE 5: Meta-Audits & Sanity Guards (20%)

Cross-checking GPT’s own assumptions and external signals.

Subcheck	Description	Weight
GPT SELF-AUDIT	Did Boss vs Interns produce contradictory analysis?	5%
G-LOG CHECKSUM MATCH	Is this output identical to a known-good logged build?	5%
TEST COVERAGE RATE	Did the build run through enough distinct test cases (N>50)?	5%
TRUSTED SDK VERIFICATION	Is the SDK verified by MODGPT and unchanged?	5%
📈 Final Confidence Score:

CSM_SCORE = Σ (All checks × their weight)

Ranges:

90–100% → "Trusted for user delivery (green)"

70–89% → "Internal test passed, but manual review recommended (yellow)"

40–69% → "Build unstable or unverified (orange)"

0–39% → "Untrusted, do not run (red)"

🛡️ Bonus: "Trust Delta Graph"

Each test scenario (e.g., PoliceScannerTest_004) should return not just pass/fail, but a delta influence on score:

Example: PoliceScannerTest_004 → PASS → +2.4%

If a regression occurs, the system should return:
PoliceScannerTest_004 → FAIL → −6.2% (high trust weight)

🧠 Future Evolution Potential:

Add probabilistic fuzzing to simulate random player behavior paths

Run virtual player agents to auto-detect crash triggers

Integrate Build Regressor AI, which learns from previously failed builds to pre-predict breakage

Attach ETA-based trust acceleration: More runs = faster trust accumulation curve

json
{
  "build": "HeadShotV_v0.8.5-test4",
  "confidence": 92.7,
  "status": "Trusted",
  "top_warnings": [],
  "failed_checks": [],
  "audit_pass": true,
  "regression_risk": "Low",
  "trust_delta": "+3.6% (since previous build)"
}


Would you like me to generate the live Confidence Calculation Engine template now for MODGPT to begin scoring builds this way in real-time?
