**You:**

Create an internal error registry that tracks every crash, stack trace, or failed build state and links it to that version hash.

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a full design proposal for an Internal Error Registry tailored to MODGPT and the HeadShotV build system. It links all crashes, stack traces, failed builds, and runtime exceptions directly to their respective version hashes, enabling traceability, regression prevention, and recovery intelligence.

‚úÖ INTERNAL ERROR REGISTRY SYSTEM (IERS)

Purpose:
Track, categorize, and timestamp all failure events across the mod lifecycle. Every entry links to a version hash, manifest, and optionally to a recovery script or fix path.

üîê Registry Schema (YAML or JSON File Format)

Each build hash is the primary key, with failure events as nested entries.

json
{
  "version_hash": "3AD7B92D8E6A4F20F9EAB839A3C438FD",  
  "build_id": "headshotv_0.7.2b_dev",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-08T02:15:34Z",
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "CRASH",
      "subtype": "Null Pointer",
      "phase": "In-Game Runtime",
      "message": "nullptr dereferenced in FireHeadshotEffect",
      "file": "Effects.cpp",
      "line": 112,
      "stack_trace": [
        "FireHeadshotEffect()",
        "HandlePlayerShot()",
        "main_tick()"
      ],
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "reproducible": true,
      "sandbox_safe": false,
      "linked_fixes": ["patch_null_guard_112"],
      "comments": "Occurred after gore mesh swap was injected.",
      "origin": "runtime_crash",
      "tags": ["runtime", "gore", "effects"]
    },
    {
      "type": "BUILD_FAIL",
      "phase": "Linking",
      "message": "unresolved external symbol 'DRAW_RECT'",
      "file": "Linker",
      "stack_trace": [],
      "severity": "MEDIUM",
      "reproducible": true,
      "sandbox_safe": true,
      "linked_fixes": ["shvlib_patch_draw_rect"],
      "origin": "compile_time",
      "tags": ["link", "missing_native"]
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total_errors": 2,
    "first_seen": "2025-06-08T02:15:34Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-06-08T02:15:34Z",
    "has_regression_history": false,
    "automated_fix_ready": true
  }
}

üß† GPT Behavior Integration

On any crash, failed test, or invalid mod behavior:

Automatically extract:

Version hash (from manifest or source hash)

File, line, message, and stack trace (if accessible)

Phase (e.g., compile, runtime, link, asset_load)

Classify:

Type: BUILD_FAIL, CRASH, REGRESSION, SANITY_FAIL, etc.

Subtype and tags

Severity: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL

Reproducibility

Sandbox-safe flag

Link:

To current manifest.json

To known fix routines or patches

To previous related errors (diff against similar hashes)

Optional: Auto-write error_log.json into build directory.

üìÅ File Location

Persistent Registry:
/.modgpt/errors/registry.json

Per-build Error Snapshot:
/HeadShotV/builds/<version_hash>/error_log.json

Optional Aggregate Dump:
/errors/summary_table.csv (for human analysis or LLM training)

üîÅ Use Cases
Use Case	Behavior
Failed Build Detected	Append error to registry.json under current hash
CEO Requests "trusted?" Check	Validate error-free and regression-free in registry
Regression Engine Runs	Compare current errors to prior successful versions
Nightly SleepSwarm Execution	Save any stack traces or logs into versioned registry entries
CEO Reviews Past Bugs	Pull from registry via UI, CLI, or AHK GUI script
üö® Future Features (Optional Enhancements)

Fingerprint Grouping: Hash crash stack traces to detect recurring bug types.

Fix-linking Intelligence: Learn which patches resolve which crash families.

Version Rollback Warnings: Warn if current build reintroduces a past fatal error.

Voice/Visual Log Attachments: Permit audio or image evidence of errors for dev testing.

üîê Example AHK or CMD Interface Command
cmd
MODGPT_query_error /version=3AD7B92D /filter=CRASH /severity=HIGH

‚úÖ Ready-to-Implement Next Steps

Approve or modify this registry schema

Assign it to persistent memory and integrate into build, trusted?, and test routines

(Optional) Auto-attach stack traces if logs exist inside .zip post-build

Would you like me to:

Lock this format into MODGPT memory as the permanent IERS schema?

Add automatic logging to future builds that fail, or only on request?

Design a GUI for browsing the error registry?

Let me know if you'd like a CSV/JSON implementation mockup too.
