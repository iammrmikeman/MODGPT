**You:**

Design an SDK version negotiation protocol so GPT knows when to fall back to older SDK mappings if newer ones break builds.

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a proposed SDK Version Negotiation Protocol for MODGPT, optimized for GTA V mod development using ScriptHookV. This protocol ensures safe fallback, accurate build compatibility, and long-term GPT adaptability in the face of SDK or game version mismatches.

üß† MODGPT SDK VERSION NEGOTIATION PROTOCOL

Purpose: Automatically determine the optimal ScriptHookV SDK version to use for any given mod build, including fallbacks, patches, or SDK-specific overrides.

üîπ STEP 0: DEFINITIONS
Term	Description
TARGET_GAME_VERSION	The GTA V build the mod is designed to run on (e.g., 1.0.2845.0).
SDK_VERSION	The version of ScriptHookV SDK currently selected for the build.
KNOWN_GOOD_SDKS	List of validated ScriptHookV SDKs confirmed by GPT to produce trusted .asi builds.
NATIVE_HASH_TABLE	The mapping of function hashes ‚Üí native names, often version-dependent.
MOD_REQUIREMENTS	The mod‚Äôs explicit requirements from its manifest.json or enforced by logic.
BUILD_FAILURE_LOG	Internal GPT record of failures per SDK version, including causes.
üîπ STEP 1: INITIAL SDK RESOLUTION

Input Sources:

manifest.json

Inferred game version from resource paths

Developer directive (e.g. ‚Äúmust support 2699.16 and 2802.0+‚Äù)

HashMap file used in mod

Logic:

pseudo
if manifest specifies SDK_VERSION:
    use that
elif manifest specifies TARGET_GAME_VERSION:
    match it to closest KNOWN_GOOD_SDK
else:
    default to LATEST_TRUSTED_SDK

üîπ STEP 2: PREBUILD COMPATIBILITY CHECK

Check all:

Native hashes used in code must exist in selected SDK‚Äôs natives.h

Linker paths must match SDK structure (e.g. ScriptHookV.lib compatibility)

Structures (e.g. Vector3, Ped, Entity) must match expected layout

Runtime assumptions (like fiber usage or VFTs) must match SDK variant

If any fail, proceed to fallback resolution.

üîπ STEP 3: FALLBACK RESOLUTION TREE
üîÅ Standard fallback order:
pseudo
try current SDK
if fail:
    try immediate previous trusted SDK (one version lower)
    if fail:
        try oldest compatible SDK from known-good list
        if fail:
            try SDK used in last trusted build of this mod
            if fail:
                alert: no compatible SDK found

üîß Special cases:

If native mismatch caused failure, remap from older SDK‚Äôs hash map if possible

If build fails due to .lib mismatch, attempt manual patching or force-linking

If runtime crash detected post-build, flag SDK as semi-broken and test next fallback

üîπ STEP 4: SDK LOGGING AND MEMORY

For every build attempt:

Store SDK version, hash mappings used, and result status (success, link error, runtime crash, etc.)

Link result to build hash for replayability

If SDK fails 3+ times for different builds, demote it from KNOWN_GOOD_SDKS and alert for manual review

üîπ STEP 5: AUTO-PATCH AND MAP REPAIR

If known hashes from current build are missing from the SDK:

Search previous SDK hash tables for match

If found:

Suggest temporary #define overrides (e.g. #define OLD_NATIVE 0xAABBCCDD)

Log as HYBRID_SDK_BUILD

Mark for deeper rebuild pass later

üîπ STEP 6: MOD-LOCAL OVERRIDE

Allow mod‚Äôs manifest.json to explicitly override:

json
{
  "sdk": {
    "version": "1.0.617.1a",
    "fallbacksAllowed": true,
    "forceHashOverride": true
  }
}


This prevents unwanted SDK drift in trusted builds.

‚úÖ OUTPUTS

Each build includes a build.sdk.json:

json
{
  "used_sdk": "1.0.617.1a",
  "fallback_used": false,
  "fallback_chain": [],
  "hash_map_used": "sdk_hashes_6171a.json",
  "build_result": "success"
}


Failures log:

json
{
  "used_sdk": "1.0.2845.0",
  "fallback_used": true,
  "fallback_chain": ["1.0.2845.0", "1.0.2699.16", "1.0.2372.2"],
  "last_successful_sdk": "1.0.2372.2",
  "error": "unresolved extern 'GET_ENTITY_HEALTH'",
  "fix_suggested": "use native remap from sdk_hashes_2372.json"
}

üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY FLAGS

trusted_only: only use SDKs previously verified by developer

strict_native_match: abort if any native not found in SDK

allow_patch: allow hash redefinitions from past mappings

üß© FUTURE INTEGRATION

Tie this protocol into test asi, build, and verify? commands

Eventually allow GPT-rewritten SDK variants with only required natives

Would you like this formalized into an actual .cmd-triggerable negotiation script or integrated as a memory policy into the swarm engine?
