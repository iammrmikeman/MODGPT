MODGPT | Forensic Error Tracker Proposal v1.0
Role: Forensic Error Tracker
Objective: Permanently track, fingerprint, and bucket all mod-related crashes or failures into structured, auto-actionable categories to aid in debugging, regression tracking, and autonomous repair logic.

‚öôÔ∏è SYSTEM OVERVIEW
üîí Goal

Establish a permanent, recursive crash logging system that:

Detects and logs every mod-related crash

Fingerprints the cause

Maps it to a "Fixable Bucket"

Links the crash to the relevant GPT logic or mod change that introduced or failed to catch it

Stores it in a version-stamped, build-bound, and traceable format for future audits or fixes

üß† KEY CONCEPTS
üß¨ 1. Crash DNA

Each crash is hashed into a Crash Fingerprint (CFP) using the following fields:

Stack trace (trimmed, hashed)

Mod version ID

Error class (NullPointer, NativeMismatch, InvalidHook, etc.)

Active logic module (e.g., ModInit.cpp, RenderLoop.cpp, HitProcessor.cs)

Trigger event (onTick, onPlayerDamage, etc.)

Platform conditions (GTAV build, ScriptHookV version, game settings)

json
{
  "crash_id": "CFP_1249E-91AB2",
  "error_type": "AccessViolation",
  "source": "RenderLoop.cpp:239",
  "bucket": "Memory Misalignment",
  "mod_version": "v0.34a-20250607",
  "trigger": "onTick",
  "shv_version": "1.0.617.1a",
  "stack_hash": "91AB2"
}

üì¶ 2. Fixable Buckets

Each crash is assigned to a "Fixable Bucket", representing a fix pattern:

Bucket Name	Description	Fix Action Pattern
Native Mismatch	Invalid or missing native call or signature	Patch natives.h, update call params
Null Access	Null pointer usage or invalid game entity	Add null check or existence assert
Bad Hook Timing	Hook triggered at wrong phase of loading	Delay with state check (e.g., IS_PLAYER_PLAYING)
Buffer Overwrite	Memory corruption or excessive write	Limit data size, use bounds-safe routines
SHV SDK Fault	Outdated or corrupted ScriptHookV SDK usage	Regenerate using trusted SDK
Async Misfire	Logic ran in async context but touched sync-only memory	Enforce mutex or move to main thread
Resource Leak	Game entity spawned but not released	Add destructor or scope-based release logic
External Dependency Fail	Missing file, DLL, or invalid reference	Mark as incomplete build
Random Non-Reproducible	Stack diverges across runs, likely race or external mod	Quarantine, run deterministic mode replay
üõ†Ô∏è OPERATIONAL FLOW
üß™ 1. Error Detection

On .asi crash, MODGPT intercepts:

dmp or pdb file if available

Stack trace via integrated Visual Studio logging or external crash catcher

Exit codes (0xc0000005, etc.)

In-game indicators (e.g., screen freeze, corrupted frame, redline freeze, log termination)

üß∑ 2. Crash Fingerprint Creation

MODGPT hashes the relevant data ‚Üí creates CFP

Looks up any matching crash from previous builds

If match found ‚Üí link to prior Fix Ticket

If new ‚Üí assign provisional bucket

üß∫ 3. Bucket Assignment

Rule-based parser classifies based on:

Error type + location

Surrounding context

Known patterns (e.g., access violation in RenderLoop = memory overwrite)

üîÅ 4. Learn-and-Fix Loop

Each bucket links to:

Automated fix attempt templates

Past successful patches

Code generation recipes (if fixable)

üßæ DATA STORAGE FORMAT

Crash Registry:

Stored in mod_name/crashes/CFP_<id>.json

Also linked in manifest as last_crash_fp and crash_severity

json
{
  "cfp": "CFP_1249E-91AB2",
  "bucket": "Memory Misalignment",
  "fixable": true,
  "autofix_ready": false,
  "stack_trace": [...],
  "linked_builds": ["v0.34a", "v0.34b"],
  "last_seen": "2025-06-07T23:50Z"
}

üìâ FAILURE SEVERITY SCALE
Severity	Meaning	GPT Response
üî¥ CRIT	Causes full crash or freeze	Block build, flag CEO, halt swarm
üü† MAJOR	Game functional, but corrupted behavior	Auto-ticket, pause feature rollout
üü° MINOR	UI glitch, slight logic regression	Log only, low-priority fix
üîµ COSMETIC	Visual-only / harmless bug	Optional fix, track for polish pass
üîí TRUST PIPELINE INTEGRATION

A crash in any CRIT or MAJOR bucket immediately:

Drops build trust score

Blocks trusted? from passing

Creates a traceback chain for dev profiling

Links to last code commit, swarm thread, and GPT logic decision (if relevant)

üß† LEARNING SYSTEM

All crash data is piped into GPTAIDLEARN_CRASHES, allowing:

Pattern recognition (frequent logic failure in one module = audit)

Intern or swarm role blame attribution (if they wrote logic leading to CFP)

Auto-scheduling of test asi or simulate frame if needed

üîÆ FUTURE ADD-ONS

Mod Replay Buffer: Record key gameplay state near crash for replay

Visual Crash Map: Show crash frequency by mod logic module in overlay

Fix Suggestion Engine: GPT proposes fixes with confidence scores per bucket

Voice Alert Integration: Audible cue if crash is detected during playtest

‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

If approved, Boss should:

Authorize permanent crash_registry directory for all mods

Approve auto-bucketing logic to become active immediately

Assign intern CrashBucketGPT to train on real-world EVERYHEADSHOTVBUILD.zip failures

Tie this to the trusted? and verify? pipeline enforcement

Would you like me to write the first CFP autotracker module now?
