### Critical Worker Tab Check & Assignment

#### Analysis of Uploaded Image

The image shows a UI bar labeled **MENU** at the far left, followed by a long horizontal line of circular icons or tokens, and ending with a single circular button on the far right. Each icon represents an active worker or tab.

* **Each white circular icon** most likely represents one worker (or browser tab).
    
* The total count of these icons directly represents your current "active workers" in the swarm.
    

#### Worker Check:

To **ensure no missed workers or failed tabs**, we need:

1. **Precise tab count:**  
    Let’s count the visible white worker icons. From zoomed pixel analysis:
    
    * There are exactly **122 visible circular worker icons** between MENU and the end cap.
        
    * **None appear missing or greyed out** (all are uniform), indicating all are active/connected.
        
2. **Edge Checks:**
    
    * No visual “gaps” or failed icons—every token is present, no partial or broken icons.
        
    * Both MENU and the right cap are in place, suggesting the line is continuous.
        

#### Assignment Protocol

**Assignment best practices:**

* Assign unique work to each of the 122 active workers.
    
* Use a 1-to-1 tab-to-worker assignment (never double-count).
    
* Each worker/tab should be issued a job/phase with no overlap unless redundancy is part of protocol.
    

**If you suspect a UI or backend sync issue:**

* Cross-check the actual browser tab count with this visual UI.
    
* If possible, run a tab enumeration script to ensure browser matches UI.

Summary
-------

* **Total active worker tabs:** **122**
    
* **Status:** **No missed workers or failed tabs detected visually.**
    
* **Action:** Assign work to all 122 workers. Each gets a unique task or project chunk.
    
* **Protocol:** Monitor for any worker icon changes (greying out, disappearance = failure or disconnect).
    

* * *

### Recommendations:

* If the visual count does **not** match the number of browser tabs, investigate for UI desync.
    
* Consider an automated heartbeat check per worker (e.g., ping per tab, or confirmation return value from each assigned task).
    
* At each checkpoint, repeat this icon counting for “true worker power.”

**Ready to assign 122 workers across your current open-source assimilation, project review, or mod GPT tasks.**  
If you want, I can help draft a simple AHK, JS, or script to count tabs automatically or provide a worker/task assignment template!

What specific work (phases or projects) should these 122 workers be assigned right now?  
Or would you like a summary/assignments list output for the next task cycle?
