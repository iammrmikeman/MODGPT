Draft GPT behavior for post-build self-reflection: it must document how it built the mod and what decisions were made.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a draft of MODGPT post-build self-reflection behavior, suitable for integration into the HeadShotV mod pipeline or any future GTA V .asi mod:

üîÑ MODGPT Post-Build Self-Reflection Protocol (v1.0)

Trigger: Automatically runs immediately after a successful build command.

Purpose:
To create a full, structured log of GPT‚Äôs reasoning, decisions, and contextual factors that influenced the build. This ensures accountability, version traceability, and allows intelligent regression analysis or replay of past builds.

üßæ HEADER
markdown
## üß† MODGPT POST-BUILD REFLECTION
**Mod Name:** HeadShotV  
**Build Timestamp:** 2025-06-08T02:14Z  
**Build ID (Hash):** abc1234def567890  
**GPT Version:** MODGPT v0.01 (Boss 4.o)  
**Swarm Mode:** Active (SleepSwarm[30])  
**Human Confirmed:** False  

üîç BUILD CONTEXT
markdown
### CONTEXT SNAPSHOT

- **Mod Objective:** Enable cinematic headshot reactions using physics + VFX
- **Supplied Assets:** 
  - `headburst_model.ydr`
  - `ScriptHookV.lib`
  - No config or XML files present
- **Assumptions Made:**
  - Missing XML will be dynamically generated
  - Only Enhanced GTA V is targeted
  - No legacy compatibility required

‚öôÔ∏è GPT DECISIONS MADE
markdown
### CORE DECISIONS (AUTOMATED)

1. ‚úÖ **SDK Fallback Activated:** 
   - Used ScriptHookV 1.0.617.1a due to build conflicts with 3521.0

2. ‚úÖ **Dynamic Asset Injection:**
   - No `.meta` or config files were provided
   - Default config values injected using INIT_FALLBACK protocol

3. ‚úÖ **Header Sanitation Pass:**
   - Stripped deprecated or unused headers: `dbg.h`, `placeholder_func.h`

4. ‚úÖ **Native Usage Review:**
   - Only validated natives used: `PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND`, `DRAW_RECT`
   - No risky or deprecated functions detected in final call tree

5. ‚úÖ **Visual Output Mapping:**
   - Red-screen flash triggered using `DRAW_RECT` timed to 5s intervals
   - Police scanner sound triggered with `SOUND::PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND`

### SELF-EVALUATION

- **Confidence Score:** 92.3%
- **Potential Instability:** Medium-low (risk from missing model LODs not yet verified)
- **Most Fragile Logic Path:** Damage condition ‚Üí Bone mapping ‚Üí Trigger ‚Üí VFX chain
- **Most Robust Path:** Timer ‚Üí Audio trigger ‚Üí ScriptHookV validation

**GPT Believes:**
> This build represents a minimal but working form of the HeadShotV core loop. The build is stable, but lacks detailed VFX layering and per-weapon variation logic. Next iteration should include full VFX chain testing and real-time config reload support.

GPT made no blind guesses. All decisions had a fallback policy or known assumption path.

üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE SNAPSHOT
markdown
### FINAL FILE STRUCTURE

- /src/
  - main.cpp
  - logic_headshot.cpp
  - vfx_trigger.cpp
- /assets/
  - headburst_model.ydr
- /headers/
  - script_hookv_sdk/
- /manifest/
  - mod_manifest.json
- /build_logs/
  - BUILD_20250608_REFLECTION.md

üß© NEXT RECOMMENDED STEPS
markdown
1. Validate `.ydr` with mesh + LOD inspector
2. Add `weapons.meta` overrides for projectile types
3. Expand trigger logic to distinguish between pistol, rifle, shotgun
4. Add runtime config reload toggle (keybind: INSERT?)


This reflection log will now be:

Saved to disk and linked to mod version hash

Readable in any future regression test

Searchable for decision audits or trust tracking

Embedded in mod manifest for release tracking

Would you like this converted into a formal .md template, or should I prepare an .ini/.json-based lightweight variant for non-markdown environments (e.g., internal game logging)?
