üî¨ Task: Study ScriptHookV (SHV) thread behavior, infinite loop safety, and yield correctness.

üß† MODGPT THREADING STUDY: SHV Architecture
üß© 1. ScriptHookV Thread Model

ScriptHookV executes script logic via custom fibers, not OS-level threads. Each script gets its own IScriptThread derivative (e.g., CScriptThread), and SHV manages the thread's lifecycle.

SHV calls the Run() method of your custom thread repeatedly in a tight loop, yielding between calls.

The internal tick handler is bound to OnTick inside the main loop.

The core loop runs approximately once per frame (~60 FPS), but this is not guaranteed.

üîÅ 2. Infinite Loop Risk

Because the Run() method is executed inside a repeating loop (SHV‚Äôs scheduler), an infinite loop inside Run() will:

Stall the main ScriptHookV thread.

Freeze other scripts, including the SHV native context.

Potentially crash the game or cause watchdog-triggered exceptions.

Unsafe pattern:

cpp
void Run() override {
    while (true) {
        // NEVER DO THIS in SHV
    }
}


Safe pattern:

cpp
void Run() override {
    while (true) {
        // safe code
        WAIT(0);  // yields control
    }
}

üîÇ 3. WAIT() and yield Correctness
‚úÖ WAIT(ms) Macro

Internally maps to:

cpp
#define WAIT(ms) scriptWait(ms)


Which instructs SHV to yield execution for ms milliseconds (though this is not real-time accurate).

üîç How it works:

scriptWait() stores the delay and returns control to SHV‚Äôs scheduler.

SHV will not resume your script until the requested delay has passed.

You must call WAIT() or some yielding function at least once every Run() cycle to prevent CPU lock.

Yieldable Calls:

WAIT(ms)

yield() (explicitly in fiber-based scripts)

Native blocking calls like TASK_PAUSE, AI_WAIT, etc. do not yield ScriptHookV control ‚Äî they only affect game entities.

üîê 4. MODGPT Policy: Loop & Yield Enforcement

All SHV-based GTA V mods must include:

A WAIT() call or equivalent inside every loop iteration.

A yield-safe shutdown path.

No yield-skipping on tick-bound logic.

Maximum loop iteration time per frame: <10ms ideal, hard cap <16ms.

üß™ 5. Diagnostics Strategy

To verify thread safety in .asi mods:

Trace all loop bodies for WAIT presence.

Static analysis of Run() or custom thread methods.

Look for unbounded calls (e.g., while(true) or for(;;)) with no yield.

Measure impact via injected benchmark timers or profiler hooks.

üß∞ 6. Sample Fixable Offender

Before (unsafe):

cpp
void Run() override {
    while (true) {
        // Update logic
    }
}


After (safe):

cpp
void Run() override {
    while (true) {
        // Update logic
        WAIT(0);
    }
}


Would you like a diagnostic tool that can scan SHV source for infinite loops or missing yields in .cpp files or zips you upload?

Or should I now scan previously uploaded zips (like ALLGPTFILESEVER(KINDASORTED)_2.zip) for violations of this thread policy?
