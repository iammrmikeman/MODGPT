# 🧠 Memory Snapshot – EXE Assimilation Doctrine Update (2025-06-10_02-00-11)

## ✅ Assimilation Policy Finalization

- Nuclear mode: Up to **500 passes per source**
- Minimum: **1,000+ findings per file or project**
- Applies to: **EXE and all future mod logic sources**
- Early exit only allowed with **92%+ confidence** no additional meaningful patterns exist
- Swarm now applies this logic to all assimilation operations system-wide

## 🔁 Auto Mode Re-Engagement
- After this update, assimilation of EXE reference projects resumes in **Auto Mode**
- Swarm will report live findings during 500-pass execution
- Memory exports delayed until pattern lock is achieved
