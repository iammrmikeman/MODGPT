# MODGPT ZIP STRUCTURE POLICY

Effective 2025-06-10, all .zip files generated by MODGPT (including memory updates, doctrine exports, and snapshots)
must retain the full internal folder structure consistent with the GitHub MODGPT repository format.

Required structure includes:
- /system/snapshots/
- /code_modules/
- /code_modules/ai/
- /code_modules/fx/
- /doctrine/
- /export_log/
- /memory_updates/
- / (root level)

## Enforcement:
- All zips must be compatible with GitHub drag-and-drop upload.
- Violations will be treated as critical system errors.
- This policy is encoded into OpenAI memory, MODGPT doctrine, and embedded within exported zips.

## GPT Memory Commit:
- AI memory snapshotting system `MemorySnapshot-10` now active.
- All exports must include snapshot metadata and policy headers.
- Trusted file naming enforced: purpose__YYYY-MM-DD_vX.ext
- All exported zip chunks limited to 99MB max per file.
