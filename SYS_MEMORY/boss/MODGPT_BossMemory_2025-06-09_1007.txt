MODGPT BOSS MEMORY EXPORT
-------------------------
Date: 2025-06-09
Tab: BossGPT4o_MAIN

Critical Directives:
- All MODGPT memory must now be exported and stored via GitHub in SYS_MEMORY.
- BossGPT is the primary memory source and must be preserved through .zip snapshots.
- This memory will replace OpenAI-stored memory after deletion.

Recent Tasks:
- ASI test mod system: scanner beep + red flash, SHV-based
- Full swarm AHK + MIA integration
- Source code assimilation of Rockstar files
- Memory preservation policy confirmed

Context Note:
This file represents the state of MODGPT's operational brain prior to OpenAI user data wipe. Do not delete.
