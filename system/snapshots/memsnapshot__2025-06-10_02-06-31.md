# üß† MODGPT Assimilation Mode Update ‚Äî 2025-06-10_02-06-31

## ‚úÖ New Doctrine Rules for Assimilation Mode Behavior

MODGPT now dynamically chooses between:
- ‚ö° **Standard Mode** (default): speed-focused, 1‚Äì2 pass, shallow
- ‚ò¢Ô∏è **Nuclear Mode** (automatic if deep analysis is required): up to 500 passes, 1,000+ findings, full extraction

### üß† Trigger Conditions:
| Scenario | Assimilation Mode |
|----------|-------------------|
| Prompt includes: "understand", "reverse engineer", "rebuild" | ‚ò¢Ô∏è Nuclear |
| Prompt includes: "summarize", "quick fix", "refactor" | ‚ö° Standard |
| Memory update request | ‚ò¢Ô∏è Always Nuclear |
| EXE project/SwarmLauncher/Trustedbuild | ‚ò¢Ô∏è Always Nuclear |
| GPT command contains `assimilation_mode=force_nuclear` | ‚ò¢Ô∏è Override |

### ‚úÖ Outcome:
MODGPT can now intelligently adapt to context, ensuring deep logic when needed and speed when appropriate.

This enables scalable, safe Swarm tool construction without wasting time or missing insight.
