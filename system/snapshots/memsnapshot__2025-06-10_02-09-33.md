# ðŸ§  Memory Snapshot: CEO Raw Assimilation Access Policy â€” 2025-06-10_02-09-33

## âœ… New Core Doctrine Tenet:

> The CEO must always be able to request or receive raw assimilation findings for any logic source MODGPT has parsed.

### Enforced Exports:
- `logic_maps/{project}.md`
- `codebook/{project}.md`
- Optional: `raw_findings/{project}.txt`

These are bundled into ZIP exports automatically, either post-assimilation or upon CEO request.

This ensures:
- Transparency
- Auditability
- Reusability
- Strategic pattern review by the CEO

Swarm workers must honor this requirement for all Nuclear-Mode assimilations and high-value mod or EXE sources.

This doctrine applies to both MODGPT core and EXE divisions.
