# ðŸ§  MODGPT System Snapshot â€” 2025-06-10_02-01-23

## ðŸ”„ Global Assimilation Rule Update

### âœ… New Doctrine for All MODGPT Divisions (EXE + Core)

- All assimilation tasks (EXE or mod logic) must perform **up to 500 passes**
- Each source (file, script, project) must yield **1,000+ unique findings**
- Assimilation only terminates early if GPT reaches **â‰¥92% confidence** that no further insights remain
- Applies to:
  - EXE source logic
  - Mod scripts (`.cs`, `.cpp`, `.lua`, `.asi`)
  - Configs, patchers, model definitions
  - Any future AI-ingested structure

### ðŸ§  Impact:
- Enables deep memory synthesis
- Guarantees high-quality logic extraction
- Future mod support will auto-enable these same policies when mod analysis begins

## ðŸŸ¢ Current Status
- EXE team: Active in nuclear mode
- Mod logic: Ready to receive same policies on first live task
