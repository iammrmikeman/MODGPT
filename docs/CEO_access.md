# ðŸ‘‘ CEO Access â€” Assimilation Doctrine

## Permanent Doctrine Rule (Activated: 2025-06-10_02-09-33)

The CEO is entitled to full, raw access to all MODGPT assimilation findings. This includes:

- ðŸ§  `logic_maps/{project}.md`
- ðŸ“˜ `codebook/{project}.md`
- ðŸ“„ `raw_findings/{project}.txt`

This access ensures MODGPT remains transparent, auditable, and synthesizable at the human level.

Swarm workers must be able to package this data upon request or as part of memory updates.
