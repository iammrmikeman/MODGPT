Thanks to help from Availu from NVE TEAM, I have learned onigri.asi is limited to 15mb files (GTAV Code Issue)

Notes

From CEO mod Natrual Vision Enhanced Gore Varierty,
In my tests it seems the game sometimes doenst load the higher quality fxdecal.ytd included in NVE located in NVE_Update instead, atleast on my system
(CPU Intel Core i7-6700 Nvidia 1070-8gb). The game sometimes resorts to using base game textures.
For this reason, a compressed 14.9mb platform\textures\fxdecal.ytd file will still be included in this version. Please report any findings :)
