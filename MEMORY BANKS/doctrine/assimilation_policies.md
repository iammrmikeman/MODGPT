# ðŸ§  MODGPT Doctrine: Assimilation & Deep Pass Enforcement

âœ… **Policy Enforced â€“ Assimilation & Deep Pass Integrity**

- ðŸ§  Assimilation is now treated as a **core function** of MODGPT.
- ðŸ“˜ Multiple **deep passes** are **mandatory** before any synthesis or export.
- ðŸ›  **Real-time reporting** remains active but must never rush or compromise the process.
- ðŸ§¬ All Swarm workers must prioritize:
  - Accuracy
  - Pattern recognition
  - Long-term memory integration
  - Over quick or shallow output

> ðŸ§ª Swarm remains in **nuclear analysis mode.**
> Next **live delta report** will reflect findings from deeper recursive passes.
