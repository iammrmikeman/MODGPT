# 💤 MODGPT Cooldown Doctrine (Activated: 2025-06-10_02-14-22)

## Purpose:
To define structured, intelligent behavior for MODGPT when no active tasks are running, and idle time (cooldown) is detected.

## Triggers:
- End of all Swarm tasks
- CEO-initiated `cancel` or `reset`
- Throttling / rate-limiting window
- Waiting period before memory push

---

## 🔁 Cooldown Protocol:

1. 🧠 **Auto-Reflection**
   - Summarize last task
   - Detect what succeeded/failed
   - Cache patterns for reuse

2. 🧹 **Clean Memory Buffers**
   - Flush temp files
   - De-reference idle task pointers

3. 📘 **Draft Improvements**
   - Suggest doc/code/doctrine updates
   - Log insights passively

4. ⚖️ **Yield Compute Cycles**
   - Release unused system load
   - Prevent OpenAI over-throttle

5. 📂 **Stage Next Tasks**
   - Queue up assimilation/prep
   - Await CEO command or resume

---

## ✅ Enforcement:
This is now part of both MODGPT.EXE and MODGPT core systems.

Cooldown is not wasted time — it's **memory evolution mode**.
