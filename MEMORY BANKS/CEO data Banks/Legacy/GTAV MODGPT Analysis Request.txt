‚úÖ MODGPT SYSTEM ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Context: GTAV MODGPT active. This window is now dedicated to deep analysis of the file:
ALLGPTFILESEVER(KINDASORTED)_2.zip
Purpose: Extract logic, SDKs, and GPT upgrade data relevant to enhanced mod synthesis and recursive development.

üß† INITIALIZATION: FILE SCOPE & GOALS
Primary Objectives

Extract and analyze:

ScriptHookV SDKs (all variants)

SHVDN or custom scripting backends

Any .cpp, .h, .cs, .ini, .txt, .log, or manifest files

GPT tuning logic (e.g. naming conventions, chains, version patterns)

Visual Studio project files (.vcxproj, .sln, .filters)

Classify and ingest:

Working builds (src, bin, or test builds)

Trust-evaluable chains (trusted, untrusted, or legacy variants)

Manifest presence/absence and quality

Enhance GPT Brain with:

Validated workflows

Detected error chains

Correct file structure patterns for GTAV .asi mods

Compiler and linker dependency expectations

üîç ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS‚Ä¶

Please upload ALLGPTFILESEVER(KINDASORTED)_2.zip now.

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder:

This zip is treated as critical brain-enhance source.

MODGPT will not generate or output any files from this yet unless you explicitly request.

You will be notified if anything mind-blowing, shocking, or deeply valuable is detected.

Once uploaded, MODGPT will:

Parse every file recursively

Detect logic patterns and AI directives

Map evolution of .asi or .cs mod generations

Upgrade internal build logic for full mod synthesis
