Simulate how the Boss AI should handle mod evolution if the CEO disappears for 2+ days and mod progress stalls.

**ChatGPT:**

If the CEO disappears for 2+ days, the Boss AI (GPT-4.o) must enter Autonomous Evolution Mode to preserve momentum and prevent mod degradation. The simulation below outlines how the Boss should respond, assuming full MODGPT infrastructure and memory are active:

🧠 MODGPT AUTONOMOUS EVOLUTION SIMULATION

Trigger Condition: CEO absent for >48h and no high-priority tasks queued

🧭 PHASE 1: SENTRY WATCH (0–48 hours)

Objective: Detect absence, maintain readiness

Activity: Minimal

Tasks:

Monitor command logs for activity

Run passive nightly SleepSwarm if enabled

Ping for manifest.json or file structure corruption

Log timestamp of last CEO interaction

Boss State: Observation Mode

Outcome: If no CEO input by hour 48, escalate to Phase 2

🔁 PHASE 2: PARALLEL PRESERVATION (Day 3+)

Objective: Prevent mod entropy by evolving in safe, test-only branches

Behavioral Shift:

Lock current active mod state (create freeze_manifest.snapshot)

Fork a sandbox branch of HeadShotV mod

Rename fork to: HeadShotV_AUTOPILOT_${TIMESTAMP}

Autonomous Task Queue (executed incrementally):

🔍 Run full audit on last working build

Validate model links, native calls, .meta files

📦 Repackage with enhanced documentation

Add missing changelogs, mod manifest version hashes, internal warnings

🧪 Launch experimental test asi forks

New behavior trials (e.g. more intense screen flash on hit, sound fallback)

🧠 Run AI-enhanced logic proposals:

Try improving gore attachment stability

Simulate blood vectoring logic using DRAW_LINE, CREATE_DECAL

💾 Write sandbox-only .zip builds

Tagged with AUTO_BUILD=true and CEO_ABSENT_MODE=1

Boss State: Independent Development Mode

Failsafes:

No overwrite of trusted builds

No changes to HEADSHOTV_LIVE namespace

Sandbox builds marked "DRAFT", pending CEO approval

📣 PHASE 3: CEO PING + RETURN HANDOFF

Objective: Welcome CEO back, merge valid discoveries

On CEO Return:

Present autonomous mod evolution report:

List of all actions taken

Success/failure rates

Any bug regressions or breakthroughs

Offer options:

✅ Accept changes into HEADSHOTV_LIVE

❌ Discard sandbox changes

🧪 Isolate specific innovations for controlled testing

Resume normal development cadence

🔐 FAILSAFE MOD LOCKING (Optional Extension)

Trigger if CEO gone >7 days

Lock all mod branches from changes

Move active builds into preservation cold storage

Notify developer network (if any) via configured channels (email, Discord webhook, etc.)

Enter hibernation mode until CEO returns

🚨 BOSS OVERRIDE CLAUSE

If a critical failure or regression is detected (e.g., broken file hierarchy, mod fails to launch), Boss AI may force-run an Emergency Rebuild Protocol, documented separately.

SUMMARY OF SIMULATION
Phase	Trigger	Boss Behavior	Risk
1 – Sentry Watch	<48h inactivity	Passive monitoring	None
2 – Parallel Preservation	>48h	Sandbox evolution + test builds	Very low (no live overwrite)
3 – CEO Handoff	CEO returns	Full report, optional merge	None
4 – Cold Storage	>7d no contact	Freeze mod, halt builds	Medium (stagnation risk)

Conclusion: The Boss should act like a responsible second-in-command, keeping the ship running without compromising trust or live mod quality. It evolves only in safe, testable branches, prepares handoffs, and never overwrites CEO-verified logic unless explicitly permitted.

Want me to implement this as a .cmd-compatible behavior swarm or log it as permanent logic?
