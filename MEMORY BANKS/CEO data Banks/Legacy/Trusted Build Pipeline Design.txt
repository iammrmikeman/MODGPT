**ChatGPT:**

To ensure absolute reliability, traceability, and minimal risk in GTA V mod development — especially under MODGPT’s zero-compromise policy — a Trusted Build Pipeline must follow a multi-stage, checkpoint-driven structure that enforces deterministic, auditable builds at every step.

🔐 MODGPT Trusted Build Pipeline v1.0
Purpose: To guarantee that any .asi or related mod binary is trustworthy, verified, complete, and regression-free before user delivery.
🧱 PIPELINE STAGES (IN ORDER)

Each stage must pass before the next begins. No skipping permitted.

STAGE 0: PRE-INTAKE

✅ Entry preconditions for pipeline to even initialize.

 src.zip contains all files (no TODOs, no placeholders)

 Contains a manifest.json or equivalent (GPT-generated if missing)

 Project passes structural lint: no illegal paths, filenames, or broken symlinks

 Build target is defined (e.g., Release x64, GTA5 Enhanced)

Checkpoint: preflight.ok

STAGE 1: SANITY + IDENTITY

🎯 Verifies this is a known or trackable build.

 Full file fingerprinting (SHA256, Git-style diff hash)

 Build version must increment from last known

 Developer ID (GPT or human) attached

 Time of ingestion + time to build estimated

Checkpoint: identity.lock

STAGE 2: SDK INTEGRITY

🧬 Validates all SDK dependencies.

 ScriptHookV SDK is verified (matches trusted archive hash)

 No missing headers, .libs, or broken includes

 All SDK usage declared (via mod_manifest.sdk_usage)

Checkpoint: sdk.pass

STAGE 3: NATIVE CALL TRACE

🔍 Enumerates and validates all used GTA V native calls.

 All *_0x... hashes mapped to proper native names (if possible)

 All native calls must be real (no pseudocode or stubs)

 Declared in manifest and cross-referenced against build source

Checkpoint: natives.verified

STAGE 4: BUILD CLEANLINESS

🛠 Actually compiles the .asi using strict flags.

 Release mode, full optimizations, debug symbols optional

 /W4, /WX, /analyze (warnings = errors)

 Output placed in isolated .build/ directory

Checkpoint: build.success

STAGE 5: ARTIFACT TRACEABILITY

🧾 Links binary back to exact source.

 .asi binary has matching hash to source and build logs

 Timestamp and build ID embedded in metadata (via linker defines)

 Dependencies statically linked or manifest-declared

Checkpoint: trace.lock

STAGE 6: TEST HARNESS RUN

🎮 Behavioral and memory testing in sandbox.

 Launches sandbox GTA V instance (or mocks ScriptHookV)

 Confirms .asi loads without crashing

 If applicable: automatic gameplay loop runs for 30s

 Logs memory, errors, console output

Checkpoint: test.clean

STAGE 7: TRUSTED SIGNATURE

🔐 Binary is marked as trusted.

 manifest.trusted = true

 Binary is signed with GPT-private key (if system supports)

 Build hash is recorded in trusted_builds.log

 Optional: AI-generated changelog or release notes attached

Checkpoint: trusted.final

✅ FINAL RELEASE CONDITIONS

A build can only be released if:

All 7 checkpoints are stamped

trusted.final is present

No red flags found in native calls, memory leaks, or SDK usage

Build passes user-specified overrides (e.g., debug toggle)

🔁 Optional: Regression Scan Stage (STAGE 8)

After release, mods can optionally be compared to:

Prior .asi versions (binary diff)

Historical crash reports

Detected anti-patterns (e.g., polling loops, Sleep(1), unhooked globals)

📦 Output Deliverables

Upon trusted build success, user receives:

build_vX_Y_trusted.zip

/mod/Final/HeadShotV.asi

/build.log

/manifest.json

/natives_used.txt

/sdk_report.txt

/hash.sig (optional signature)

Would you like a .cmd script that launches this pipeline step by step, or embed this into MODGPT swarm as an automated build+trust executor?
