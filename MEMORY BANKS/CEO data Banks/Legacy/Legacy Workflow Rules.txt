show me my rules for headshot 5 we are going to work on them

**ChatGPT:**

Here's your consolidated and simplified set of rules currently governing the HeadShot V project workflow. They reflect the latest and most critical points you've established:

üìå HeadShot V - Project Rules

üöÄ Unified Automated Workflow

Automatic Fixes: Safely fix any code/configuration issues immediately.

Full Scan: Deep multi-pass scan (visible + hidden errors).

Immediate Re-scan: After fixes, re-scan thoroughly.

Integrity Check: Military-level (byte-level) corruption detection.

üìÇ Source Zip Creation Rules

Structure Validation:

/src/: All .cpp files.

/inc/: All .h header files.

/Models/: headburst.ydr asset.

/compiled/: .asi output location.

File Integrity:

No placeholder/dummy files unless explicitly explained.

No missing, corrupted, or junk files.

.vcxproj & .sln files synchronized.

Logs & Changelogs:

Build logs saved to: logs/HeadShotV.log.

Full detailed changelog (from earliest build), no dates, clear formatting.

üîç Error Detection & Fixing

Aim for 5+ visible and 10+ hidden errors each scan.

Clearly report errors (bullet points, line numbers).

Apply fixes only after exhaustive error discovery.

üõ†Ô∏è Build Output & Config

.asi files output automatically to:
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\Projects\GTA5E\HeadShotV\compiled

Visual Studio: auto-detect & match toolset (PlatformToolset).

Always ensure valid Release|x64 config.

üóÉÔ∏è Anti-Corruption & Debugging (CGPT_AID)

Store detailed file-size history and corruption diagnostics:

makefile
C:\Users\pc\Desktop\Projects\GTA5E\HeadShotV\CGPT_AID


Adapt path automatically per mod.

‚úÖ Final Checks (Mandatory)

Post-zip verification every build:

Validate structure, completeness, and integrity.

Byte-level final validation.

üì• Download Links

Always clearly marked & verified.

Positioned clearly at the bottom of responses.

Follow exact formatting guidelines:

scss
üì¶ [Download FileName.zip](link)
‚Ä¢ feature1
‚Ä¢ feature2
‚úÖ Risk status clearly shown


üìú Versioning Strategy

Current: 0.487+

Major: fully loads (0.5), new features (0.6), etc.

Minor (0.4.x, 0.5.x): fixes and incremental improvements.

‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Notifications

Notify immediately if files needed.

Clearly warn if actions risk build stability or functionality.

No waiting/pause if safe fixes identified.

This structured view helps ensure smooth workflow, clear error management, robust file integrity, and efficient debugging throughout the HeadShot V mod development.

HeadShot V - Project Rules

== Unified Automated Workflow ==
- Automatic Fixes: Immediately apply safe fixes to code and config issues.
- Full Scan: Deep multi-pass scan (both visible & hidden errors).
- Immediate Re-scan: Perform a thorough re-scan after every fix.
- Integrity Check: Military-level (byte-level) validation for corruption.

== Source Zip Creation Rules ==
- Structure Validation:
  ‚Ä¢ /src/ (All .cpp source files)
  ‚Ä¢ /inc/ (All .h header files)
  ‚Ä¢ /Models/ (headburst.ydr asset file)
  ‚Ä¢ /compiled/ (.asi output files location)
- File Integrity:
  ‚Ä¢ No placeholder or dummy files (unless explicitly explained).
  ‚Ä¢ No missing, corrupt, or junk files.
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure synchronization between .vcxproj and .sln files.
- Logs & Changelogs:
  ‚Ä¢ Build logs location: logs/HeadShotV.log
  ‚Ä¢ Changelog: Full detail from earliest build, concise format, no dates.

== Error Detection & Fixing ==
- Target: 5+ visible and 10+ hidden errors per scan.
- Reporting: Bullet-point errors with clear file names and line numbers.
- Fixing: Only apply fixes after exhaustive error discovery and reporting.

== Build Output & Configuration ==
- ASI output auto-directed to:
  C:\Users\pc\Desktop\Projects\GTA5E\HeadShotV\compiled
- Visual Studio: Automatically detect and match PlatformToolset.
- Always confirm valid Release|x64 configuration.

== Anti-Corruption & Debugging (CGPT_AID) ==
- Store detailed file size history and corruption diagnostics at:
  C:\Users\pc\Desktop\Projects\GTA5E\HeadShotV\CGPT_AID
- Automatically adapt CGPT_AID folder per mod project path.

== Mandatory Final Checks ==
- Post-zip verification (every build):
  ‚Ä¢ Structure and integrity check.
  ‚Ä¢ Byte-level validation at final stage.

== Download Link Rules ==
- Always clearly marked and verified.
- Position clearly at the bottom of responses.
- Follow exact formatting:

  ‚Ä¢ Feature 1 description
  ‚Ä¢ Feature 2 description
  ‚úÖ Risk status clearly indicated

== Versioning Strategy ==
- Current version: 0.487+
- Major increments: First full load (0.5), new features (0.6, etc.).
- Minor increments (0.4.x, 0.5.x): Fixes and incremental improvements.

== Critical Notifications ==
- Immediately notify if user files are required.
- Clearly warn if an action risks build stability or functionality.
- Apply safe fixes immediately; avoid unnecessary waiting.
