**You:**

Design a rolling build hash system: every version of HeadShotV gets a fingerprint tied to its logic and model files.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To fingerprint every HeadShotV build with a rolling build hash, we need a deterministic system that captures both logic and model identity, ensures traceability across build generations, and resists tampering or accidental mismatches. This system must also support rollback, comparison, and forensic audit.

‚úÖ GOAL

Design a Rolling Build Hash (RBH) system that assigns a unique cryptographic hash to every HeadShotV build based on:

C++ logic files (.cpp, .h, .lib)

Model assets (.ydr, .yft, .ydt, optional .otd)

Build settings and manifest

Evolution lineage (link to prior build hash)

üîÅ ROLLING BUILD HASH (RBH) SYSTEM DESIGN
üîê 1. HASH STRATEGY

Use a composite Merkle hash formed from:

Individual file hashes (SHA-256)

A build metadata block

A rolling parent hash reference

json
RBH Structure:
{
  "build_hash": "SHA-256(MERKLE_ROOT + parent_hash + meta)",
  "parent_hash": "prev_build_hash",
  "logic_hashes": {
    "main.cpp": "<sha256>",
    "HeadShot.h": "<sha256>",
    "ScriptHookV.lib": "<sha256>"
  },
  "model_hashes": {
    "headburst.ydr": "<sha256>",
    "bloodsplatter.ytd": "<sha256>"
  },
  "manifest_hash": "<sha256>",
  "meta": {
    "build_time": "2025-06-08T01:33:00Z",
    "sdk_version": "ScriptHookV_3521.0_814.9",
    "gpt_version": "MODGPT v0.01",
    "compiler_flags": "-O2 /EHsc",
    "ai_decisions": ["fallback_audio=enabled", "sandbox_high_risk_natives=true"],
    "dev_notes": "Gore model added, new LODs in headburst.ydr"
  }
}

üì¶ 2. FILES INCLUDED
‚úÖ Required for fingerprint:

All .cpp, .h, and .lib files used in the build

All .ydr, .yft, .ytd, and .ydt assets

All .meta, .xml, and .json config files used by the mod

Final manifest file (must be SHA-verified first)

‚ùå Excluded from fingerprint:

Temporary/intermediate files

Compiler output (.obj, .pdb, etc.)

Readme or changelogs (included optionally in meta only)

üîÑ 3. VERSION EVOLUTION

Every build links to its previous build hash:

yaml
Genesis Build:   RBH_00000000  (No parent)
  ‚Üí Patch 1:     RBH_AABBCCDD  (Parent: RBH_00000000)
    ‚Üí Patch 2:   RBH_9911EE44  (Parent: RBH_AABBCCDD)


This forms a tamper-proof chain, allowing:

Precise rollback

Version diffing

Ancestry analysis

üß™ 4. DETECTION OF INVALID HASH STATES

At each build:

All asset and logic files are hashed before compilation

GPT verifies:

No placeholder logic (TODO, STUB)

All models have valid LODs and skeletons

Hashes are re-calculated after manifest generation

If any logic file is changed post-hash, GPT blocks the build

üß¨ 5. FUTURE EXTENSIONS
üõ°Ô∏è Trusted Builds Registry

Each RBH can be uploaded to a central mod registry (trusted.json) for whitelist validation and auto-verification in MODGPT tools.

‚õìÔ∏è Chain Integrity Scanner

A tool to walk the RBH ancestry chain and report:

Hash mismatch

Missing parent

Broken lineage

üß† GPT Reflection

Each RBH stores a GPT self-reflection block: a short justification from MODGPT on why this build exists and what changed.

Would you like:

‚úÖ GPT to auto-generate this hash on every build?

üîÑ A recalculate_hash command to force re-hash with custom file filters?

üîó A persistent build_chain.log file to track ancestry locally?

üí£ Build lockout if any hashes mismatch?

Let me know if we add encryption or signatures next.
