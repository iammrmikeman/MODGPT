Here's your refined message with GTA V-specific categories and clearer focus:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman, a mod author contributing popular GTA V Enhanced mods here on Nexus Mods. Currently, all mods for GTA V Enhanced Edition fall under "Miscellaneous," making it challenging for users to browse effectively as the number of mods grows.

It would significantly improve user experience and mod discoverability if GTA V-specific categories could be introduced. Popular modding sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com offer good inspiration. Recommended categories include:

Vehicles

Weapons

Scripts

Graphics

Gameplay

Player/Pedestrian

Maps & Locations

Missions

Clothing & Accessories

Sounds & Audio

Tools

UI & HUD

Textures

Realism & Immersion

For example, my mod "NVE Gore Variety" could comfortably fit under Gameplay or Player/Pedestrian, making it easier for players to find precisely what they seek.

Thank you for your attention and continued support of the GTA V modding community!

Best regards,
iammrmikeman

Got it — here's the revised version with a more professional, respectful tone suited for experienced moderators, avoiding anything that sounds overly casual or explanatory:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman, a contributing author with multiple well-received GTA V Enhanced mods on the platform. Currently, all content for GTA V Enhanced is grouped under "Miscellaneous," which is limiting as the category grows in volume and complexity.

To support both authors and users, it would be beneficial to introduce dedicated categories more aligned with the structure seen on GTA5-specific platforms like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com. Suggested categories tailored for GTA V include:

Vehicles

Weapons

Scripts

Graphics/Visuals

Gameplay

Player & Pedestrian Mods

Maps & Locations

Missions

Clothing & Accessories

Audio/SFX

Tools & Utilities

UI/HUD

Textures

Realism & Immersion

These are common across the GTA modding space and would streamline browsing, filtering, and showcasing high-effort work. Mods like my "NVE Gore Variety," for instance, would fit cleanly under Gameplay or Pedestrian Mods—whereas right now, it's buried under a general tag.

Appreciate the ongoing work your team puts into maintaining and evolving the platform.

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s your full, professional feedback message — GTA V Enhanced focused, secretly tailored to your content but written universally for all mod types, and based on real mod loader distinctions and gameplay depth:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman, a long-time contributor to the GTA V Enhanced community. While support for the Expanded & Enhanced version is appreciated, the current lack of proper categorization—especially with everything lumped under "Miscellaneous"—is starting to hinder usability, discoverability, and overall site organization as more creators begin targeting this edition.

Given the complexity and diversity of modern GTA V Enhanced mods, a more structured category system would better reflect the current modding landscape. Below is a proposed list of categories, drawing from how other major GTA sites segment content (e.g., GTA5-Mods and GTAInside), while also considering the unique scripting environments and evolving feature sets specific to the Enhanced version:

🔧 Suggested Categories for GTA V Enhanced

Script Types (by Loader):

Scripts: ScriptHookV (ASI)

Scripts: SHVDN (ScriptHookVDotNet / .NET)

Scripts: RAGE Plugin Hook

Scripts: Standalone (Lua / Other)

Scripts: FiveM/SP-Compatible

Gameplay & Immersion:

Gameplay Overhauls

Realism & Immersion Tweaks

Driving & Vehicle Handling Mods

Combat & Gore Mods

Physics Enhancements

AI Behavior & Law Enforcement Tweaks

Pedestrian Mods & NPC Logic

Content Additions:

Vehicles (Add-On / Replace)

Weapons (Custom / Retexture / Stats)

Clothing & Accessories

Maps & Locations

Missions & Scenarios

Player Models & Characters

Visual & Audio:

Graphics / Visual Overhauls

Textures & Retextures

Weather & Lighting Mods

Audio / SFX (Voices, Guns, Ambience, etc.)

UI / HUD Enhancements

Utility & Development:

Tools & Utilities

Installation Frameworks & Loaders

Compatibility Patches

Developer Resources / Base Templates

This structure reflects how GTA V Enhanced has evolved beyond just minor tweaks. Mods now often span multiple systems—from physics and AI to deeper gameplay integrations. For instance, a mod like NVE Gore Variety would be more discoverable under "Combat & Gore Mods" or "Gameplay Overha

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely — here's a toned-down, clean version that stays professional, avoids self-promotion, and still pushes for the expanded GTA V Enhanced mod structure. It's quietly tailored to support your own mod types without spotlighting them:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'd like to suggest an update to the GTA V Enhanced mod category structure. Currently, all mods are filed under "Miscellaneous," which makes it increasingly difficult to browse as more creators begin targeting the Expanded & Enhanced version.

To improve navigation and encourage more targeted uploads, it would be helpful to adopt a dedicated category set similar to what's used on GTA5-Mods or GTAInside—adapted specifically for GTA V Enhanced, with its current tools and scripting formats in mind.

🔧 Suggested Categories for GTA V Enhanced:

Script Types (Loader-Specific):

Scripts: ScriptHookV (ASI)

Scripts: SHVDN (.NET)

Scripts: RAGE Plugin Hook

Scripts: Standalone / Lua

Scripts: FiveM-Compatible (SP Friendly)

Gameplay & Systems:

Gameplay Overhauls

Realism & Immersion Tweaks

Driving & Handling Mods

Combat & Gore

AI / Wanted Level Tweaks

Physics Enhancements

Pedestrian / NPC Behavior

Content & Add-Ons:

Vehicles (Add-On / Replace)

Weapons (New / Rebalanced / Retextured)

Clothing & Accessories

Player Models

Missions & Scenarios

Maps & Locations

Visual & Audio:

Graphics / Visual Overhauls

Texture Packs

Weather / ENB / Timecycle

UI / HUD Mods

Audio / SFX Mods

Utility & Backend:

Tools & Utilities

Loaders / Installation Helpers

Compatibility Patches

Modding Resources

This structure would improve sorting and help separate foundational scripting work from content mods, while making it easier for players to locate immersive enhancements, realism tweaks, and technical utilities. A more focused breakdown will also make the Enhanced Edition feel less like an afterthought and more like its own thriving space on the platform.

Thanks for your time and for continuing to support the GTA modding scene.

**ChatGPT:**

Here's the final refined version — it mentions you're a known author of popular mods, but keeps the tone grounded and focused on constructive feedback:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'm a contributor to the GTA V Enhanced section and the author of a few popular mods currently hosted on the site. I wanted to suggest a structural improvement that could benefit both users and creators going forward.

At the moment, all GTA V Enhanced mods are placed under "Miscellaneous," which makes it difficult to browse or organize the growing variety of content targeting the Expanded & Enhanced version. Given how active the community has become, it might be time to introduce proper categories tailored specifically to this version’s features and formats.

Below is a suggested breakdown, based on established standards from GTA-specific sites like GTA5-Mods and GTAInside, and adapted for the technical realities of Enhanced Edition:

🔧 Suggested Categories for GTA V Enhanced:

Script Types (Loader-Specific):

Scripts: ScriptHookV (ASI)

Scripts: SHVDN (.NET)

Scripts: RAGE Plugin Hook

Scripts: Standalone / Lua

Scripts: FiveM-Compatible (SP Friendly)

Gameplay & Systems:

Gameplay Overhauls

Realism & Immersion Tweaks

Driving & Handling Mods

Combat & Gore

AI / Wanted Level Tweaks

Physics Enhancements

Pedestrian / NPC Behavior

Content & Add-Ons:

Vehicles (Add-On / Replace)

Weapons (New / Rebalanced / Retextured)

Graphics / Visual Overhauls

Texture Packs

Weather / ENB / Timecycle

UI / HUD Mods

Audio / SFX Mods

Utility & Backend:

Tools & Utilities

Loaders / Installation Helpers

This kind of structure would not only improve clarity and mod discoverability, but also help differentiate the Enhanced Edition as a platform with its own unique development needs. Appreciate the work your team puts into maintaining this space.

**You:**

first draft was best more like that but obey rules

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — here's a final version that keeps the clean, confident tone of the first draft, but with your latest instructions fully respected:

Hello Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman, a mod author with a few well-received contributions to the GTA V Enhanced section. At present, all mods for the Expanded & Enhanced edition are grouped under “Miscellaneous,” which is becoming a limitation as the category grows in both volume and complexity.

To better reflect the variety of mods being developed specifically for this version, I’d like to propose a more structured set of categories. These suggestions are based on formats used across dedicated GTA sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com, but refined to suit the technical reality of Enhanced modding and its multiple scripting environments.

🔧 Suggested Categories for GTA V Enhanced:

Scripts (by Loader):

Scripts: ScriptHookV (ASI)

Scripts: ScriptHookVDotNet (SHVDN)

Scripts: RAGE Plugin Hook (RPH)

Scripts: FiveM-Compatible (SP Friendly)

Scripts: Lua / Standalone

Gameplay & Immersion:

Gameplay Overhauls

Combat & Gore

Driving & Handling Mods

Physics Enhancements

Realism Tweaks

Pedestrian & AI Behavior

Add-On Content:

Vehicles (Add-On / Replace)

Weapons (Custom / Rebalanced / Retextured)

Clothing & Accessories

Player & Pedestrian Models

Missions / Scenarios

Maps & Locations

Visual & Audio:

Graphics / Visual Overhauls

Textures & Retextures

Weather / ENB / Timecycle

UI / HUD Mods

Audio / Sound Effects

Tools & Utilities:

Modding Tools

Installation Frameworks / Loaders

Compatibility Patches

Developer Resources

This kind of layout would make it far easier to surface specific mod types, and help authors properly classify their work instead of relying on generic tags. Mods like mine—focused on gameplay mechanics, gore effects, and realism—would be much easier to find under appropriate categories.

Appreciate all the effort your team puts into the platform and hope this helps contribute to further growth in the GTA V Enhanced space.

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely — here’s a more natural, human-toned version of your message. It keeps the structure professional but removes that overly "scripted" AI feel, while still hitting all the points you wanted:

Hi Nexus Mods Team,

I’m iammrmikeman — I’ve uploaded a few GTA V Enhanced mods over the past year that have done fairly well, and I just wanted to leave a bit of feedback.

Right now, all Enhanced Edition mods fall under “Miscellaneous,” and with the way things are growing, that’s starting to feel pretty limiting. More and more creators are building mods specifically for the Expanded & Enhanced version, and it would really help if we had proper categories to organize them.

Sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com already break things up in a way that works well for the GTA community, but this could be adapted for Nexus in a way that fits how Enhanced mods are actually built.

Here’s a list that I think would cover most bases:

🔧 Suggested GTA V Enhanced Categories

By Script Type:

Scripts: ScriptHookV (ASI)

Scripts: ScriptHookVDotNet (.NET)

Scripts: RAGE Plugin Hook

Scripts: FiveM-Compatible (SP-Friendly)

Scripts: Lua / Other Standalone

Gameplay & Immersion:

Gameplay Overhauls

Combat & Gore Mods

Driving & Handling Mods

Physics Tweaks

Realism Enhancements

Pedestrian & AI Behavior

Content Mods:

Vehicles (Add-On / Replace)

Weapons (Custom / Retextured / Stats)

Player Models & Peds

Graphics / Visual Overhauls

Texture Packs

Weather / Timecycle / ENB

Audio / SFX

UI / HUD Mods

Utilities & Frameworks:

Tools & Utilities

Installation Helpers

Compatibility Patches

Base Templates / Modder Resources

Even just a few of these would make it easier to browse, tag properly, and keep the section clean as the community grows. Mods like the ones I’ve been working on—focused on realism, gore effects, or physics—tend to get buried under “Misc” when they really don’t belong there.

Thanks for keeping GTA supported on Nexus. Would love to see this expanded a bit to keep up with how much the Enhanced version has evolved.

Hi Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman — I've released a few GTA V Enhanced mods here that have been fairly well received, and I wanted to offer a bit of feedback regarding the current category structure.

At the moment, all Expanded & Enhanced mods are grouped under “Miscellaneous,” which makes browsing and uploading increasingly messy as more creators start targeting this version specifically. It would really help if the site offered more detailed, GTA-focused categories tailored to how mods are actually built and used in Enhanced Edition.

Sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com already use a structure that works well for this community, and something similar on Nexus would improve visibility, usability, and encourage more targeted uploads.

Here’s a list of suggested categories that could help organize the section better:

Even just a few of these would go a long way in making Enhanced Edition content easier to find and properly categorize. Mods with unique gameplay mechanics, realism tweaks, or technical features tend to get buried right now, and clearer categories would help everyone — from creators to casual users.

Hi Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman — I’ve uploaded a few GTA V Enhanced mods here that have done alright, and just wanted to bring something up.

Right now, all mods for the Expanded & Enhanced version are stuck under “Miscellaneous,” and with the amount of new content being made for this version, that setup’s starting to fall short. It’s hard for users to find what they’re looking for, and there’s no clear way for modders to label things properly.

Sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com already break stuff up in a way that makes sense for GTA, and I think Nexus could really benefit from something similar — just tailored for how Enhanced Edition works.

Here’s a list that would cover most of the types of mods being made right now:

Suggested Categories for GTA V Enhanced:

Scripts (by Loader):

ScriptHookV (ASI)

ScriptHookVDotNet (.NET)

RAGE Plugin Hook

FiveM-Compatible (Single Player)

Standalone / Lua

Gameplay & Mechanics:

Gameplay Overhauls

Combat & Gore Mods

Weather / Timecycle / ENB

UI / HUD Changes

Sound & Audio Mods

Tools & Frameworks:

Utilities & Editors

Mods like mine — stuff focused on mechanics, realism, or custom effects — would finally have a proper place, instead of getting buried in a catch-all category. It’d be a small change with a big impact on how clean and usable the GTA V Enhanced section feels.

Appreciate the work you guys do keeping the platform running. Hope this helps.

Hi Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman — I’ve uploaded a few GTA V Enhanced mods here that have done alright, and just wanted to bring something up.

At the moment, all mods for the Expanded & Enhanced version are placed under “Miscellaneous.” With more people making content specifically for this version, it’s getting harder to find things and even harder to label uploads properly.

Other GTA-focused sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com already separate things in a way that works well for this community. I think Nexus could benefit from something similar — just tuned for how the Enhanced Edition is actually being modded now.

Here’s a rough list of categories that’d help clean things up:

Scripts, split by how they're loaded:

ScriptHookV (ASI)

ScriptHookVDotNet (.NET)

RAGE Plugin Hook

FiveM-compatible (SP-friendly)

Standalone / Lua-based

Gameplay & realism tweaks:

Overhauls

Combat, gore, or dismemberment systems

Driving/handling mods

Physics changes

AI & wanted level tweaks

General immersion improvements

Content mods:

Add-on or replace vehicles

Custom or tweaked weapons

Player/pedestrian models

New clothing and accessories

Story/scenario missions

Map edits or new locations

Visual & audio mods:

Graphics or ENB overhauls

Texture replacements

UI or HUD changes

Weather/timecycle edits

Sound and audio work

Tools & utilities:

Installers, loaders, and helpers

Modding frameworks

Compatibility patches

Developer resources or templates

Even just a handful of these would make the Enhanced section way easier to navigate, especially as more creators start targeting this version of the game directly. A lot of higher-effort stuff is getting buried right now.

Appreciate all the work your team does. Hopefully this helps a bit.

Visuals, broken out more clearly:

ENB / ReShade presets

Lighting mods (streetlights, shadows, night glow)

Texture replacements (roads, vegetation, interiors)

Blood / gore textures

Particle effects / explosions

Audio:

Sound effects (guns, vehicles, ambience)

Dialogue / voice replacements

Music / radio station edits

UI & HUD:

Radar and map tweaks

Custom HUDs

Menu redesigns or overlays

Tools & modding frameworks:

Installers / script loaders

Development tools

Compatibility patches

Base templates or starter kits

Even just implementing a handful of these would go a long way in making Enhanced Edition feel more supported on the site. Right now, a lot of advanced or specialized mods are getting buried because they don’t have a proper home.

site feedback

Hi Nexus Mods Team,

I'm iammrmikeman — I’ve uploaded a few mods for GTA V Expanded & Enhanced that have done fairly well, and I just wanted to suggest something that I think would really help going forward.

Right now, all GTA V Enhanced content gets thrown into “Miscellaneous,” and with the amount of new mods being made specifically for this version, that setup’s starting to feel too limited. There’s no clean way to tag or browse the kinds of mods people are actually making — especially with how many scripting methods and gameplay systems GTA uses.

Other GTA-focused sites like gta5-mods.com and gtainside.com already organize things in a way that works well. I think Nexus could benefit from something similar, but tailored to how Enhanced mods are actually built and used.

Here’s a rough structure that could really clean things up:

Scripts (split by how they’re loaded):

ScriptHookV (ASI)

ScriptHookVDotNet (.NET)

RAGE Plugin Hook

FiveM-compatible (Single Player-friendly)

Standalone / Lua / other formats

Gameplay & mechanics:

General gameplay overhauls

Combat and gore systems

Driving and vehicle handling tweaks

Physics changes

Realism and immersion

AI and wanted level behavior

Content mods:

Vehicles (add-on or replace)

Weapons (custom or reworked)

Player and pedestrian models

Clothing and accessories

Missions and scenarios

New maps, interiors, or locations

Visual changes (broken out clearly):

Graphics overhauls or presets

Timecycle and weather mods

ENB / ReShade configs

Lighting tweaks (night lights, shadows, fog)

Texture mods (roads, vegetation, interiors)

Blood and gore textures

Particle effects and explosions

Audio:

Sound effects (guns, vehicles, ambience)

Voice or dialogue replacements

Music and radio station mods

UI & HUD:

Map and radar tweaks

HUD redesigns

Interface adjustments

Tools & utilities:

Installers and loaders

Development tools

Compatibility patches

Base templates for modders

Even adding just a few of these would make a big difference. Mods with more technical work or unique mechanics — which are getting more common with Enhanced — would finally have a proper place to live.

Thanks for keeping the site running and supporting the GTA community. Hope this helps.

I'm iammrmikeman — I’ve uploaded a few mods for GTA V Expanded & Enhanced that have done fairly well, and I wanted to suggest something that could really help keep things organized as the section continues to grow.

Right now, all GTA V Enhanced mods are placed under “Miscellaneous.” With the amount of new content being made specifically for this version, it’s becoming harder for users to browse properly or for modders to label their work in a meaningful way.

Even adding a few of these would go a long way in making Enhanced Edition mods easier to find and properly sort. More and more of these mods go beyond simple tweaks, and right now they’re just getting buried.
