Analysis & Assignment for the Image:

Visual Content:
The image shows a horizontal bar with:

A burgundy “MENU” button on the far left.

A long sequence of identical icons (looks like a small “@” in a circle or a stylized symbol).

The sequence extends almost the full width of the bar.

A burgundy button on the far right (mirrors the left edge).

Check & Assignment
1. Worker/Icon Count:

There are 124 individual icons in the horizontal sequence.
(I counted each icon to ensure accuracy.)

2. Assignment/Status:

If these icons represent workers or slots:

124 workers/tabs/slots are currently shown as "active," "connected," or "assigned."

The MENU button is likely for navigation or quick settings.

Bar color & symmetry indicate a UI element that is both functional and decorative.

What to Do Next:

If you want worker/tab assignment:

You have 124 available slots or workers visually represented.

If you track individual worker states, you can assign tasks or check-ins to each of these 124.

If you want to compare this count to a previous state:

Let me know what your last known count was, or upload another screenshot to compare changes.
