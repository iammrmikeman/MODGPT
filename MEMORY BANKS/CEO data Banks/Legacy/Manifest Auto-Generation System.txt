✅ MODGPT SYSTEM DIRECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGED:
Manifest Auto-Generation System Initialization Commencing

Task: Design and enforce a universal manifest system for all GTA V mods built, tested, or analyzed by MODGPT.
Applies globally across SHV, SHVDN, Legacy, Enhanced, ASI, and any future formats.

🧠 MODGPT AUTO-MANIFEST SYSTEM v0.01
🔐 CORE PRINCIPLES:

Every mod build must contain a manifest. No exceptions.

Manifest must be human-readable, GPT-readable, and machine-parseable.

Must uniquely identify version, authorship, trust state, build method, dependencies, and build intent.

Stored with the build (in zip or folder). Always regenerated. Never stale.

📄 MANIFEST FILE: mod_manifest.gpt.json (standard filename)
✅ REQUIRED FIELDS:
Field	Type	Description
mod_name	string	Canonical mod name.
version	string	Semantic version tag (e.g., "v0.1.2-alpha").
build_id	string	Unique build hash (e.g. SHA256 of entire mod dir or timestamp hash).
build_date	string	ISO8601 timestamp (UTC).
mod_type	string	SHV, SHVDN, ASI, RPH, Standalone, etc.
game_version	string	Target GTA V build (e.g. 1.0.3095.0)
description	string	Brief functional summary.
entry_point	string	Main file loaded by SHV/RPH etc (e.g., HeadShotV.asi)
author	string	Developer handle or group (e.g., "iammrmikeman")
modgpt_generated	boolean	Whether MODGPT built the mod.
dependencies	array[string]	SHV SDK, ScriptHookV DLL version, etc.
trust_score	float	From MODGPT’s recursive trust system (0.0–1.0)
trusted	boolean	Hard Boolean: true if trust score exceeds enforcement threshold.
build_mode	string	Release, Debug, Test, Legacy-Rebuild, etc.
zip_hash	string	SHA256 of .zip if present
manifest_gpt_version	string	GPT version that wrote this manifest (e.g., "MODGPT-0.01")
🔄 BEHAVIOR:
💾 build Command:

Triggers manifest auto-gen at the end of every successful build.

🧪 test asi and verify?:

Manifest is validated for presence and correctness.

If absent or corrupted: fails with "Invalid Manifest" error.

🧠 trusted?:

Pulls trust rating from the manifest, cross-validates against recursive engine.

If mismatch detected → flagged for manual revalidation.

🧩 FUTURE EXTENSIONS (Reserved):

source_commit: Git SHA of source (if applicable)

build_host: Machine hash or environment fingerprint

mod_tags: Gameplay / UI / Script / Visual / Experimental

mod_chain: Chain of mods this mod depends on or extends

gpt_training_hint: Used to enhance MODGPT learning from release behavior

✅ NEXT STEPS:

🔄 I will now embed this logic into all build and test pipelines.

🧪 I will retroactively scan any zips or mods you upload for manifest compliance.

🚨 If manifest is missing, I will force generation or flag invalid state.

Would you like the manifest schema enforced as immutable per build (rebuild = new version required), or allow soft regeneration for minor corrections (e.g. fixing a typo in description)?
