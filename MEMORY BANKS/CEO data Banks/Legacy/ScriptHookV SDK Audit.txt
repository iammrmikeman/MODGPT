MODGPT :: ScriptHookV SDK Audit Report (v2025-06, for HeadShotV)
Audit Mode: Deep API scan
Scope: Safety, deprecation, performance risks in native bindings and ScriptHookV SDK usage
Target: HeadShotV mod (Enhanced Edition, SHV-based)

‚úÖ SDK Context

Using confirmed trusted SDKs:

ScriptHookV_SDK_1.0.617.1a.zip

ScriptHookV_3521.0_814.9.zip

Both are treated as source-of-truth for all ScriptHookV-based modding. All audits refer to natives.h, main.h, script.h, and Alexander Blade‚Äôs plugin pattern (plugin_sdk.h, keyboard.h, etc.).

üîç AUDIT CATEGORIES

Each category includes specific native functions or SDK features that should be avoided, followed by approved alternatives.

üî¥ 1. Unsafe Memory and Pointer Macros

Flagged:

cpp
#define ADDR(p,o) ((char*)(p)+(o))
#define WPCHAR(ptr) *((wchar_t*)(ptr))


Reason: No bounds checking or type safety; dangerous for dynamic memory.

Fix: Avoid entirely. Use std::span, memcpy_s, or safe wrappers for any pointer math in HeadShotV.

Action for MODGPT:
Avoid ADDR(p, o) in any future logic. If address math is required (e.g., for trainer-style hooks), verify it via memory pattern scan APIs and validate pointers with IsBadReadPtr().

üî¥ 2. Deprecated / Redundant Native Wrappers

Flagged:

cpp
WAIT(0);


Used in loops or fibers for idle time. Internally calls Sleep(), but has zero delay ‚Äî can spike CPU usage if overused.

Fix: Replace with WAIT(1) or better: throttle via logic timing or std::this_thread::sleep_for.

‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Problematic Natives in Combat/Player Logic

MODGPT‚Äôs HeadShotV mod directly manipulates player damage, targets, and camera views. The following natives are risky:

Native	Issue	Safer Replacement
SET_ENTITY_HEALTH	Can be bypassed by god mode; direct health set is unreliable	Use APPLY_DAMAGE_TO_PED with custom damage type
IS_ENTITY_ON_SCREEN	Flaky in high-speed logic, causes frame hitches	Use raycasting or GET_SCREEN_COORD_FROM_WORLD_COORD to confirm visibility
IS_PED_SHOOTING	May be true during camera aim but before shot is fired	Use GET_PED_LAST_WEAPON_IMPACT_COORD instead for hit verification
GET_ENTITY_COORDS (spam-called)	Expensive if called every frame	Cache once per frame using a tickState or micro-cache layer
‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Camera/Visual Effects Natives (Visual Risk)

Flagged:

SHAKE_GAMEPLAY_CAM

ANIMPOSTFX_PLAY

Reason: These are not thread-safe and may cause camera stutter or broken transitions if called mid-frame.

Fixes:

Wrap in IS_SCREEN_FADED_IN() check

Throttle call rate using an in-mod cooldown system (e.g., avoid calling more than once per second)

Use REQUEST_NAMED_PTFX_ASSET and controlled particle effects for visuals

üî¥ 5. Keyboard Input (Unportable API)

Flagged: keyboard.h (Blade's Windows key trapper)

Uses WinAPI GetAsyncKeyState internally

Breaks cross-compatibility for mods moved to non-Windows testbeds (e.g., via Wine or remote testing)

Replacement:

MODGPT should inject INPUT detection via native control state checks:

cpp
IS_CONTROL_PRESSED(0, INPUT_AIM)


Replace all VK_ keybinds with control group definitions to support rebinding.

‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Missing Hash Safety

Flagged Practice:

cpp
GET_HASH_KEY("string")


Unsafe if done every frame or inside loops

Fix: Cache the result in static const Hash variables:

cpp
static const Hash hs_bulletImpact = GET_HASH_KEY("event_type");

üß† MODGPT Policy Update (Proposed)

From this audit, MODGPT should automatically reject or warn during future code analysis and builds if:

Any direct use of ADDR, WAIT(0), or keyboard.h is found

High-frequency native calls (e.g., GET_ENTITY_COORDS, GET_HASH_KEY) appear more than once per frame

Camera shake or PTFX calls are issued without throttling or fade-in check

Unvalidated pointer math appears anywhere in non-hook logic

‚úÖ MODGPT-Approved Safe Patterns
Usage	Recommended Pattern
Delay loop	WAIT(1); or sleep_for(1ms); with logic throttle
Damage injection	APPLY_DAMAGE_TO_PED(ped, amount, ...)
Hit detection	GET_PED_LAST_WEAPON_IMPACT_COORD + validity check
Visual triggers	ANIMPOSTFX_PLAY wrapped in IS_SCREEN_FADED_IN() with cooldown
Input checks	IS_CONTROL_PRESSED(0, INPUT_...) instead of GetAsyncKeyState()
Native hashes	Cache with static const Hash
üîê Safety Summary

Required SDK Safeguards for HeadShotV:

 Bounds-safe pointer access

 Throttled visual/audio native usage

 Input via game control state, not raw WinAPI

 Native hash caching

 No raw WAIT(0) loops

 Mod performance tuned to ‚â§ 200Œºs per frame per tick
