üß† Task Accepted: SHVDN ‚Üî ScriptHookV Native Mapping

This thread will map out the relationship between SHVDN (ScriptHookVDotNet) native calls and ScriptHookV, providing an in-depth technical analysis of:

‚öôÔ∏è 1. Terminology & Stack Primer
Term	Description
ScriptHookV	Native C++ plugin SDK for GTA V by Alexander Blade. Allows direct native function calls (via natives.h, invoker.cpp, etc).
SHVDN (ScriptHookVDotNet)	.NET-based scripting layer that sits on top of ScriptHookV. Exposes managed C# APIs that internally invoke ScriptHookV natives.
Native Function	Internal GTA V game engine function (e.g., SET_PED_HEALTH, DRAW_RECT). Identified by hash and used by both ScriptHookV and SHVDN.

üîç 3. SHVDN ‚Üî ScriptHookV Native Mapping Logic

SHVDN translates high-level .NET APIs into low-level native calls via ScriptHookV.

Example mapping:

C# API (SHVDN)	Native Function (ScriptHookV)
Game.Player.Character.Health = 100;	SET_ENTITY_HEALTH
UI.ShowSubtitle("Hello World");	BEGIN_TEXT_COMMAND_PRINT, END_TEXT_COMMAND_PRINT
World.CreateVehicle(...);	CREATE_VEHICLE
Function.Call(Hash.SET_PED_CAN_RAGDOLL, ...)	SET_PED_CAN_RAGDOLL (via Function.Call)

üí° Function.Call(...) is SHVDN's direct bridge to ScriptHookV's native system, allowing advanced users to manually invoke any native using hashes.

üß∞ 4. Internals: SHVDN Native Dispatcher

SHVDN builds a managed-to-unmanaged bridge using:

ScriptDomain ‚Üí Script ‚Üí Function dispatcher.

Marshals arguments to ScriptHookV via NativeFunction::Invoke.

Each native:

Is identified by a 64-bit hash.

Arguments are marshaled into native memory format.

Return values are captured using unsafe code and cast to .NET types.

üîÅ 5. One-to-One Native Tracking

Most C# methods in SHVDN (e.g. Ped.Kill(), Vehicle.EngineRunning) are thin wrappers around single or batched native calls. Some examples:

SHVDN C# Method	ScriptHookV Native(s) Used
Ped.Kill()	SET_ENTITY_HEALTH(0), APPLY_DAMAGE_TO_PED(...)
Vehicle.IsOnFire	IS_ENTITY_ON_FIRE
Entity.Position	GET_ENTITY_COORDS
Camera.Rotation	GET_CAM_ROT
üß¨ 6. Custom Native Mapping Mode

To enable mapping or extraction of SHVDN ‚Üí Native links:

Use SHVDN source (public on GitHub) to trace wrappers to Function.Call(Hash.XXX).

Optionally cross-reference with GTA5 Native DB or [alloc8or‚Äôs native dump].

Use reflection or IL inspection to auto-detect native usage in .NET mods.

üìÅ 7. File-Level Mapping (Optional Task)

Want me to scan your source zips or SHVDN .dlls and map all native calls used across your mod?

I can:

Disassemble SHVDN assemblies (ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll)

Track every native invoked

Map hash ‚Üí function name

Group by feature or mod component

Say scan natives, and I‚Äôll begin immediately.

üß† Summary
Trait	ScriptHookV	SHVDN
Language	C++	C# (.NET)
Invocation	Direct via hash	Wrapped via Function.Call
Use Case	Low-level engine control	High-level mod scripting
Native Mapping	Hash-based	Name ‚Üí Hash mapping
Flexibility	Maximum	High, but abstracted
üîÆ Next Steps?

Would you like to:

Trace all native calls across a script/mod file?

Generate a lookup table of all SHVDN methods ‚Üí Native functions?

Export ScriptHookV-style wrappers for a SHVDN mod (reverse mapping)?

Or something else entirely?

Let me know what level of mapping or dissection you want.
