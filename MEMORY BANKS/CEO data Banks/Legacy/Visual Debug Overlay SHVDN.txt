**You:**

Propose a visual debug overlay (non-SHVDN) that flashes screen, logs hits, or outlines target when logic activates.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s a non-SHVDN-compatible visual debug overlay proposal for HeadShotV that:

Flashes the screen (or part of it)

Logs hits visually

Outlines or marks targets when logic (e.g., a headshot trigger) activates
—all using only ScriptHookV native functions or raw DirectX-level calls.

✅ System Name:

VDO: Visual Debug Overlay (for SHV-only environments)

🔧 1. Core Overlay Features
Feature	Description	Native / Technique
🔴 Screen Flash	Flash full screen or a corner red when logic is triggered (e.g. headshot)	DRAW_RECT, SET_TEXT_COLOUR
🧠 Hit Logger	Show hit info in HUD-space (e.g., "Headshot! BoneID: 20") for 2–3 seconds	SET_TEXT_FONT, DRAW_TEXT
🔲 Target Outline	Draw static outline/square over ped’s head or bounding box during event	Use DRAW_RECT anchored to bone world position projected via World3DToScreen2D
🧊 Freeze Frame (Optional)	Slow-mo effect or pause-frame for debug snapshot	SET_TIME_SCALE(0.01f) briefly
📈 Stat Counter Overlay	Corner overlay showing real-time mod stats like shots fired, hits, errors	DRAW_TEXT every frame
🧠 2. Technical Backbone

All rendering uses ScriptHookV and direct native access only:

No SHVDN

No scaleform-based hacks

No .cs or .lua dependencies

📌 3. Example Usage Scenario

💥 A shot lands on a ped’s head. The following happens:

DRAW_RECT: screen briefly flashes red

DRAW_TEXT: “HEADSHOT - Bone 20” appears top-right

GET_PED_BONE_COORDS + World3DToScreen2D: mark is drawn on their head

SET_TIME_SCALE(0.2f) for 0.1 seconds, then restores

🧪 4. Pseudocode (C++ / SHV style)
cpp
if (IsHeadshotHit) {
    // Flash red
    DRAW_RECT(0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 255, 0, 0, 80);

    // Display log
    SET_TEXT_FONT(0);
    SET_TEXT_SCALE(0.4f, 0.4f);
    SET_TEXT_COLOUR(255, 255, 255, 255);
    BEGIN_TEXT_COMMAND_DISPLAY_TEXT("STRING");
    ADD_TEXT_COMPONENT_SUBSTRING_PLAYER_NAME("Headshot! BoneID: 20");
    END_TEXT_COMMAND_DISPLAY_TEXT(0.85f, 0.1f);

    // Draw on target head
    Vector3 headPos = GET_PED_BONE_COORDS(targetPed, BONE_HEAD, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
    float screenX, screenY;
    if (World3DToScreen2D(headPos, &screenX, &screenY)) {
        DRAW_RECT(screenX, screenY, 0.02f, 0.02f, 255, 255, 0, 200);
    }

    // Optional slow-mo
    SET_TIME_SCALE(0.2f);
    WAIT(100);
    SET_TIME_SCALE(1.0f);
}

🛑 5. Safeguards and Optimizations

Flash duration is tied to GET_GAME_TIMER() delta

Prevent overlay spam by debounce: lastTriggerTime check

Only log hits when a toggle/debug flag is set (bool showDebugOverlay = true)

Uses static buffers where possible to avoid runtime lag

🎯 6. Optional Enhancements
Upgrade	Technique
🔎 Bone ID color coding	Flash different colors for different bones
🌀 Hit history carousel	Cycle 3–5 previous hits on screen
📸 Screenshot on trigger	Use DirectX or OpenCV call in test mode only
🎬 Target replay highlight	Record cam to show ped getting hit (future)

Would you like this overlay system scaffolded into an actual .asi source layout or embedded into a HeadShotV version as a toggleable debug mode?
