**ChatGPT:**

Certainly. Here's a high-performance folder structure tailored for long-term GTA V mod development, optimized for ScriptHookV-based projects, rebuild speed, and mod integrity across dozens of iterations. This structure is engineered for traceability, modular upgrades, trusted builds, and compatibility with automated systems like MODGPT.

🧠 MODGPT-Optimized Folder Structure: GTA_ModProject_Root/

✅ Structural Benefits for Rapid Rebuilds
Feature	Explanation
Isolated src/ and sdk/	Prevents accidental pollution of core logic with SDK files.
Precompiled lib/ and shared/	Supports incremental linking and fast rebuilds.
Clean build/ directory	Separate from src/; enables CI/CD and temp file purges.
trusted_builds/ archive	Enables mod regression testing and rollbacks.
Modular subsystems (systems/)	Encourages replaceable, upgradable modules (AI, HUD, audio).
Native mocks in test/	Speeds up unit testing without launching GTA V.
Swarm upgrade-ready	Supports AI-enhanced tooling, MODGPT integrations.
Multiple build systems	Ready for both Visual Studio and CMake builds.
🧩 Optional Enhancements (For Huge Projects)

📁 scripts/: If integrating SHVDN or Lua in non-enhanced builds.

📁 versions/: Snapshot folder for diffs between builds.

📁 crash_dumps/: Auto-collected logs from ASI crashes (with symbols).

📁 legacy/: Place older builds here only if manually preserved for research.

Would you like a ready-to-use folder scaffold .zip or a Visual Studio project template preconfigured for this structure? I can generate it on request.
