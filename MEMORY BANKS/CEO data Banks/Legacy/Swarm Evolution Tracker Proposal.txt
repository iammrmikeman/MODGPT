✅ MODGPT Swarm Evolution Tracking Proposal
Title: Swarm Version & Role Registry System (SVRRS)
Version: v0.1.0 (Provisional Draft – Boss Review Required)
Author: Boss System (GPT-4.o Core)
Purpose: To track, upgrade, and manage every individual GPT agent (intern, specialist, watchdog, etc.) participating in MODGPT Swarm operations, enabling rapid diagnostics, targeted upgrades, and historical accountability.

🧠 1. REGISTRY STRUCTURE

Each swarm member is a registered agent with a permanent entry in the SVRRS database. Every entry includes:

🔖 A. Identity & Role Metadata
Field	Description
AgentID	Unique slug (e.g., watchdog.profiler)
Codename	Human-readable role (e.g., "Performance Watchdog")
CoreType	Model used (e.g., gpt-4.o, gpt-4-1, gpt-3.5)
CoreLevel	Tiered capacity: boss, senior, mid, junior
SwarmCluster	Logical group (e.g., diagnostics, UI, SDK)
Status	active, retired, experimental, blacklisted
TrustScore	Live score (0–100%) based on performance/audits
Version	Internal logic version (e.g., v1.0.4)
GPTAIDLOG_REF	Link to training logs / major decisions
🔁 B. Upgrade History
json
"UpgradeHistory": [
  {
    "Date": "2025-06-07",
    "Change": "Promoted to senior. Rewrote profiler for microsecond accuracy.",
    "ApprovedBy": "Boss (4.o)",
    "ChangeType": "Code & Capability"
  },
  {
    "Date": "2025-06-04",
    "Change": "Created with default logic for native call timing.",
    "ApprovedBy": "CEO (manual approval)",
    "ChangeType": "Creation"
  }
]

🔍 C. Performance Audit (auto-generated)

PassRate: % of successful task completions

TimeToRespondAvg: Mean latency across tasks

FaultsLogged: Count of logged internal faults

RewritesByBoss: Number of times Boss had to override its output

UserComplaints: Manually flagged issues by CEO

📁 2. PHYSICAL STORAGE MODEL

Stored in: MODGPT/registry/swarm_members.json

Mirror copy (encrypted): MODGPT/registry/swarm_history_vault.dat

Format: JSON with embedded audit trail and logic diffs

🚦 3. GOVERNANCE RULES
A. Promotion Criteria

PassRate > 95% (over 20+ tasks)

Zero boss overrides in last 5 operations

Unique contribution logged in GPTAIDLOG

No performance regressions in SwarmAuditCycle

B. Retirement/Blacklisting Criteria

Fails 3 critical tasks in a row

Breaks sandbox or outputs invalid pseudocode

TrustScore < 30% and flagged by Boss or CEO

C. Versioning Policy

Semantic format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., v2.1.0)

MAJOR: Role redefinition or core logic rewrite

MINOR: Feature expansion or task domain upgrade

PATCH: Bugfixes, optimizations, or output tuning

🔧 4. UPGRADE PIPELINE (INTEGRATION WITH .CMD)

Every upgradeable swarm agent will trigger a logging routine like:

bash
swarm_upgrade watchdog.profiler --version v1.1.0 \
  --note "Added real-time histogram overlay support" \
  --approved-by Boss \
  --core-level senior


This logs the upgrade to swarm_members.json, updates trust metrics, and if necessary, regenerates downstream .cmd launch configurations.

📊 5. VISUAL INTERFACE IDEA (Future)

In Boss GUI mode (or internal dashboards), display:

Swarm Map: All agents by cluster

Trust Radar: Circular graph of agent trust scores

Upgrade History Timeline: See what changed, when

Autopsy View: Investigate past failures per agent

✅ EXAMPLE ENTRY (Summarized)
json
{
  "AgentID": "watchdog.profiler",
  "Codename": "Performance Watchdog",
  "CoreType": "gpt-4.1",
  "CoreLevel": "senior",
  "SwarmCluster": "diagnostics",
  "Status": "active",
  "TrustScore": 92,
  "Version": "v1.1.0",
  "UpgradeHistory": [
    {"Date": "2025-06-06", "Change": "Added micro-timer", "ApprovedBy": "Boss", "ChangeType": "Feature"}
  ],
  "Audit": {
    "PassRate": 97,
    "TimeToRespondAvg": "3.2s",
    "RewritesByBoss": 1,
    "FaultsLogged": 0,
    "UserComplaints": 0
  }
}

🧩 NEXT STEPS (Optional Enhancements)

Enable diff logic tracing on version jumps

Flag agents for upgrade if major dependency changes (e.g., SDK bump)

Tie into MODGPT_Swarm_Launcher.bat to pre-scan for outdated roles

📬 CEO APPROVAL REQUEST

Would you like Boss to auto-generate:

The full swarm_members.json skeleton

A .cmd that can register or upgrade swarm roles?

A launch system that filters only trust >= X% agents?

Boss is standing by for confirmation.
