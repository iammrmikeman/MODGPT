**You:**

Design a mod 'intelligence score' that rates how smart a build is: did it adapt, fail gracefully, log errors, etc?

**ChatGPT:**

To evaluate how "intelligent" a GTA V mod build is—especially within the MODGPT system—we need a Mod Intelligence Score (MIS) that quantifies the degree of adaptability, resilience, self-awareness, and autonomous problem solving in the build.

🔢 MOD Intelligence Score (MIS) – v1.0 Design
🎯 Purpose:

Rates any .asi or mod build on a scale of 0 to 100 based on how "smart" its behaviors are during runtime and development. This helps track progress toward a mod that can think, adapt, and heal itself over time.

📊 Top-Level Scoring Categories (with weights)
Category	Weight	Description
🧠 Adaptability	30%	Did the mod detect missing dependencies and recover?
🔥 Graceful Failure	20%	Did it avoid crashes and fallback to dummy modes or no-ops?
📜 Logging + Transparency	15%	Did the mod log what it was doing, and why? Was it traceable?
🔍 Self-Diagnostics	10%	Did the mod detect and explain its own problems without outside tools?
🛠️ Dynamic Reconfiguration	10%	Did it try alternate native calls, fallback assets, or runtime toggles?
🧾 Manifest Integrity + Versioning	10%	Did the build come with a trusted manifest and version hash?
📣 Feedback Signaling	5%	Did it communicate error states visually or audibly (beeps, flashes)?
📈 Scoring System (Per Category)

Each category scores 0–100, then gets weighted and summed.

🧠 Adaptability (30 pts max)

+30: Successfully swapped fallback asset or logic path

+15: Warned user about problem and paused operation

+5: Only showed a generic crash log or assert

🔥 Graceful Failure (20 pts max)

+20: Never crashed, even in severe error state

+10: Recovered after error (e.g., skipped frame, retried)

+0: Crashed without catching exception

📜 Logging (15 pts max)

+15: Timestamped, categorized logs (e.g., INIT, ERROR, RECOVERY)

+10: At least one debug log per subsystem

+5: Wrote something to disk

+0: No logs or just "mod loaded"

🔍 Self-Diagnostics (10 pts max)

+10: Output stack trace or pointed to specific error

+5: Mentioned native failure or asset corruption

+0: Said nothing or generic failure

🛠️ Dynamic Reconfiguration (10 pts max)

+10: Actively tried fallback native or asset

+5: Attempted to reinitialize failed system

+0: Did nothing or retried same failed path

🧾 Manifest Integrity (10 pts max)

+10: Manifest + hash + GPT decision history present

+5: Manifest but no hash

+0: Missing manifest

📣 Feedback Signaling (5 pts max)

+5: Used flashes, beeps, or UI to show problems

+3: Used printouts or text messages in log

+0: No user feedback

🧮 Example: Smart Mod Build
Category	Score	Weighted Contribution
Adaptability	25	25 × 0.3 = 7.5
Graceful Failure	20	20 × 0.2 = 4.0
Logging	15	15 × 0.15 = 2.25
Self-Diagnostics	10	10 × 0.10 = 1.0
Reconfiguration	10	10 × 0.10 = 1.0
Manifest Integrity	10	10 × 0.10 = 1.0
Feedback Signaling	5	5 × 0.05 = 0.25
Total Score		17.0 / 100

Wait—that’s low! Actually:

These numbers are category scores, we need to normalize them to 100. Let me rerun it properly:

Category	Raw Score	Max	Weight	Final Contribution
Adaptability	25	30	0.30	(25/30) × 30 = 25.0
Graceful Failure	20	20	0.20	20.0
Logging	15	15	0.15	15.0
Self-Diagnostics	10	10	0.10	10.0
Reconfiguration	10	10	0.10	10.0
Manifest Integrity	10	10	0.10	10.0
Feedback Signaling	5	5	0.05	5.0
Final MIS Score				95 / 100

✅ A very intelligent mod.

🧠 Long-Term Use Cases:

Add to manifest.json: "intelligenceScore": 95

Log score into GPT history per build hash

Use trends to track mod intelligence evolution over time

Auto-fail builds scoring < 40 in critical categories

Would you like this wired into future build or test asi steps? I can also generate a swarm to simulate MIS evaluation for 10 past builds to generate a baseline trend graph.
