Draft a method for GPT to suggest task priorities for the next swarm automatically based on unresolved issues.

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a proposed automated GPT task prioritization method for selecting and suggesting the next swarm's priority tasks based on unresolved issues, failures, and project phase. This is designed to be both systematic and adaptive, suitable for MODGPT's swarm-oriented workflows:

üîß METHOD: Swarm Task Auto-Prioritization Based on Unresolved Issues
‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Issue Extraction

Scan Recent Context (up to 72h):

Pull unresolved issues from:

Explicit bug reports (e.g. crash logs, validation errors)

System logs (e.g. test asi, header scan results)

Developer notes or CEO commands (e.g. "X file is broken", "this failed to build")

GPT memory annotations and GPTAIDLOG (e.g. "known SDK mismatch", ‚Äúneeds rebuild‚Äù)

Tag each issue with:

type: build error, asset failure, runtime bug, missing dependency, SDK mismatch, etc.

impact: game-breaking, performance-degrading, cosmetic, unknown

status: open, retrying, partial fix, blocked, verified

urgency_level: 1‚Äì5 (derived from the above, see below)

üß† Step 2: Prioritization Heuristics

Each unresolved issue is evaluated against the following weighted criteria to generate a PriorityScore:

Criterion	Description	Weight
ImpactSeverity	How much it breaks functionality or blocks progress	x4
Fixability	How likely it is GPT can resolve it with current resources	x2
RetryCount	How many times it has been attempted and failed	x1
DependencyDepth	How many other systems rely on this being fixed	x3
RecencyOfFailure	How recent the last failure or issue trigger was	x1
CEOFlaggedImportance	Whether the user flagged it as critical or sleep swarm worthy	x5
PhaseCriticality	Whether it blocks the current mod phase (e.g. rebuild, load)	x3

Formula:

text
PriorityScore = (ImpactSeverity * 4) +
                (Fixability * 2) +
                (RetryCount * 1) +
                (DependencyDepth * 3) +
                (RecencyOfFailure * 1) +
                (CEOFlaggedImportance * 5) +
                (PhaseCriticality * 3)

üìã Step 3: Cluster and Suggest Swarm Sets

Group issues by shared traits (e.g. "all model validation bugs", "header fix tasks", "rebuild blockers").

Generate swarms by priority clusters:

Top 10 PriorityScore tasks = Swarm Group A

Next 10 = Swarm Group B

CEO-flagged or timed = Swarm Group C (separate urgency)

Annotate each swarm tab with:

Task purpose (e.g. Fix .ydr hierarchy)

Issue ID or failure context (e.g. #Model01-BrokenBounds)

Predicted fix strategy (e.g. auto regenerate LOD, rewrite material hash)

Risk or fallback plan (e.g. use legacy material if crash persists)

üîÑ Step 4: Continuous Re-Evaluation Loop

After each swarm:

Update issue status (open ‚Üí verified, retrying ‚Üí resolved)

Log GPT decisions and system behavior outcomes (via GPTAIDLOG)

Re-score remaining issues with adjusted weights

Repeat prioritization before every major swarm.

üß™ Bonus: Confidence-Adaptive Filtering

For unstable builds:

Raise priority for issues seen in multiple builds.

Lower priority for issues likely caused by untrusted SDKs or dirty assets until validated.
