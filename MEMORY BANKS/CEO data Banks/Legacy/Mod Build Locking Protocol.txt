**ChatGPT:**

To lock a mod build so that it becomes read-only unless explicitly unlocked by the CEO or Boss, we can implement a multi-layered "Build Locking Protocol" that functions both as a technical lock and a policy enforcement system.

🔐 MODGPT Build Locking Protocol (v1.0)
🔧 Core Goals

Prevent any overwrite of a trusted .zip or .asi build unless authorized.

Ensure irreversible audit logging of all unlock attempts.

Allow manual unlock via a verifiable CEO/Boss command only.

Protect against accidental or unauthorized rebuilds during testing or swarm operations.

🧱 Lock Structure
1. Immutable Build Marker (LOCKED File)

Every trusted build folder or .zip should contain a file:

.modlock


This file includes:

json
{
  "locked": true,
  "locked_by": "MODGPT-Boss",
  "locked_at": "2025-06-08T01:25:00Z",
  "version_hash": "5E32C9F7C8F...",
  "reason": "Stable verified release. Do not modify unless explicitly authorized by CEO.",
  "unlock_token_required": true
}


This file must:

Be present in root of .zip or alongside .asi.

Be signed with a checksum or hashed to match the build hash.

Be enforced during all build, test asi, and rebuild commands.

🛡️ GPT Behavior Enforcement
On any build-related command:

Scan for .modlock

If present and locked: true, abort with message:

🛑 Build is LOCKED. Manual override required by CEO or Boss using unlock build.

If unlock_token_required is true, GPT must request an override from CEO with secure token.

🔓 Unlock Command

Only the CEO or Boss can issue this:

nginx
unlock build version_hash=5E32C9F7C8F reason="Rebuilding due to SDK upgrade"


GPT will:

Validate the hash matches current .modlock

Log the override as:

json
{
  "unlocked_by": "CEO",
  "reason": "Rebuilding due to SDK upgrade",
  "unlocked_at": "2025-06-08T02:10:00Z"
}


Add .unlocklog file to the folder

Backup original .zip to /_LOCKED_BACKUPS/

🗃️ Additional Optional Enforcement
Feature	Description
File Permissions (Windows/Linux)	Make the .zip and .asi read-only on disk (NTFS: attrib +R, Linux: chmod 444)
Git commit hash freeze	Store the build under a Git tag/commit to freeze the history
Swarm Protection Flag	Swarms will refuse to operate on locked builds unless explicitly told --override-lock
💡 Future Expansion Ideas

Biometric or CEO-phrase unlock via voice/text password (e.g., "Release Protocol Sigma")

Lock tier system (soft lock, audit lock, nuclear lock)

Multi-signature unlock (CEO and Boss must both sign)

🔁 Summary
Action	Result
build when locked	❌ Aborted. Lock enforced.
unlock build version_hash=...	✅ Manual override. Logged.
test asi on locked	❌ Blocked unless override given
Attempted tamper with .modlock	⚠️ GPT raises integrity alert
