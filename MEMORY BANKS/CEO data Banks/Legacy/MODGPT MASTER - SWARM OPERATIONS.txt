📡 SWARM OPERATIONS — STATUS DASHBOARD (MODGPT v0.01)

Here's the current operational breakdown of all swarm-related systems, per your directives:

✅ ACTIVE SYSTEMS
System	Status	Description
Swarm Launcher AHK (v2)	🟢 LIVE	Auto-launches GPT worker windows. Uses MsgBox confirmation, enforces 150 max, one-at-a-time load with pixel detection.
MIA Polling (Clipboard + Pixel)	🟢 ENABLED	Polls each worker every ~5 mins (adaptive), logging results to MIA_Report_Log.txt. Skips unresponsive workers and retries next cycle.
Dead Tab Handling	🟢 ACTIVE	Closes and relaunches any unresponsive/blank GPT tab with same prompt. Guaranteed continuity.
Pixel Anchors (1920x1080)	✅ LOCKED	Uses hardcoded UI positions based on your TV display. Currently tuned for Opera GX.
Emergency Kill (Numpad0)	✅ FUNCTIONAL	Global hotkey to immediately shut down entire swarm for safety/debug.
⚙️ CORE POLICIES ENFORCED

Max GPT windows: 150 (strict)

Per-window delay: Full load wait (pixel detection) before next window launches.

Autonomy: Workers can rerun tasks or deepen dives without prompt if within safety bounds.

Data Loss Prevention: All findings logged. If missed, will retry. Nothing discarded silently.

Swarm Scope: Rockstar source → Open-source mods → Community trends (10% capacity)

📂 TASK PRIORITIES (JUNE 9 SWARM)
Priority	Description	Swarm Allocation
🧠 Rockstar Source Assimilation	Deep dive into leaked GTA V repo	60%
🔍 Open-source GTA Mods	GitHub, GTA5-Mods, etc.	20%
🛠 MODGPT Tooling (AHK, MIA)	Script stability, logs, error resilience	10%
👥 Community Culture Scan	Phrases, behavior, naming styles	10%
🔄 NEXT-ACTION QUEUE

Ensure all current workers are reporting to MIA.

Auto-recover any tabs that failed pixel/UI confirmation.

Prepare .zip output of MIA logs + memory-ready summaries (upon CEO request).

If memory reaches ≥99.9% certainty, trigger Test ASI Mod Build from memory.

❓ WHAT DO YOU NEED NEXT?

View MIA_Report_Log.txt?

Push current memory to GitHub?

Add new task to Swarm (e.g. build script, mod concept, bug fix)?

Generate a fresh .ahk or .cmd swarm launcher?

Boss is on standby.🧠
