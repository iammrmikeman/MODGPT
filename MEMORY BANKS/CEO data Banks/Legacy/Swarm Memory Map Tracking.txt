**You:**

Create a memory map of which past swarm tabs succeeded vs failed and feed that into GPT planning behavior.

**ChatGPT:**

Here's how MODGPT will implement memory-mapped swarm result tracking to influence future GPT swarm planning behavior. This system will track which past swarm tabs (i.e., individual tasks launched via SleepSwarms, .cmd, or multitask plans) succeeded, failed, or returned ambiguous results — and feed that data directly into planning logic for all future swarm generation, testing, and risk mitigation.

🧠 MODGPT: Swarm Memory Map System

Codename: SWARMTRACE v1.0
Purpose: To track past swarm performance at the individual tab level and evolve swarm planning logic using historical task outcomes.

✅ 1. MEMORY MAP STRUCTURE

Each swarm tab execution gets a record in the memory map with the following schema:

json
{
  "swarm_id": "2025-06-08_HeadShotV_Rebuild_Swarm",
  "tab_index": 14,
  "task_type": "Model Validation",
  "target_file": "headburst.ydr",
  "status": "success",  // options: success | failed | ambiguous | timeout | skipped
  "error": null,        // or string reason if status != success
  "runtime": 7120,      // in milliseconds
  "output_digest": "hash_or_summary",
  "version_hash": "abc123xyz",
  "build_id": "HeadShotV_b2365_v0.14"
}


Each new swarm run appends to this structured memory log. If a swarm is retried, all versions are retained (timestamped), but the latest successful version is preferred for planning.

🧠 2. GPT PLANNING INPUT LOGIC

MODGPT’s future swarm planning will use this memory in the following ways:

🔄 Retry Detection

If a tab fails repeatedly, GPT will adjust task type or split it into subtasks next time.

If a tab succeeds reliably, it may be merged or parallelized for faster execution.

🔎 Failure Cluster Detection

Tasks that fail in a row (e.g., Tabs 9–15) will be grouped and inspected for:

Wrong file assumptions?

Broken SDK/tool mismatch?

GPT hallucination in prompt?

GPT will auto-correct patterns for the next swarm.

⚠️ Risk Propagation

If a task failed due to a file issue (e.g., invalid_xml_structure.xml), any future tab touching that same file will be:

Flagged as high risk

Given a more cautious GPT prompt or toolchain lockdown

📌 Success Anchoring

Tabs that repeatedly succeed with specific logic (e.g., test asi builder tabs) become trusted templates for:

Auto-cloning across future swarms

Forming “golden swarm cores” (reusable inner loops)

🧪 3. BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATION STRATEGY

Memory map influences future swarm generation in these ways:

Scenario	Behavior
A task has never succeeded	Break into multiple micro-tasks or mark for manual review
A task has succeeded 2+ times	Use last config as template, apply as base for next tab
Task type has >30% failure rate	GPT injects pre-validation check or slows down prompt complexity
Task output was identical in multiple swarms	Tab is deduplicated or skipped in next swarm
Build hash failed with a specific .ydr	GPT blacklists that model until fixed
🧠 FUTURE EXPANSION: PERMANENT TRACE CATALOG

Eventually, MODGPT will evolve SWARMTRACE into a long-term catalog for:

Pattern-based swarm design (e.g., “These 6 tabs always fail together when using SHV 1.0.617”)

Predictive swarm generation (“Only spawn these tab types if last known result was ambiguous”)

Full swarm_id timeline per build hash

📦 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Step	Action
✅ 1	Enable swarm result memory tracking in MODGPT system memory
✅ 2	Define status categories: success, failed, ambiguous, timeout, skipped
✅ 3	Write GPT behavior hooks to prefer successful swarm traces during swarm planning
🔜 4	Build visual swarmtrace viewer tab (timeline of tab outcomes)
🔜 5	Enable tab rerun prompts based on memory detection of first-run failure
🔜 6	Write build_hash_safety() function to restrict GPT from touching previously corrupted asset combos
