**You:**

What is best for our headshotV mod project

**ChatGPT:**

For your HeadShotV mod project, where you're working with GTA V modding using C++, ScriptHookV, and Visual Studio, here‚Äôs what you need based on your screenshots and objectives:

‚úÖ Best GPT Model for Development

From your second screenshot:

üîπ Use GPT-4o (currently selected)

It's the fastest and smartest model available with full capabilities.

Best for:

C++ debugging

Visual Studio project setup

GTA V native integration

Complex reasoning (e.g. file/folder structure, source validation)

Do not switch to GPT-4.5 or 4.1 unless you‚Äôre explicitly testing them. GPT-4o is the correct choice.

‚úÖ Best Explorer Tool for Mod Development

From your first screenshot:

üîπ Top relevant GPTs from Explore

Python ‚Äî not relevant (we're using C++, not Python).

Software Architect GPT ‚Äî useful if you want help designing the mod's system architecture or planning code modules.

Code Copilot ‚Äî good for general code help, similar to what you're already doing here.

HTML + CSS + JS ‚Äî irrelevant for a GTA V native mod.

DesignerGPT ‚Äî not relevant.

Unreal Engine 5 Expert ‚Äî irrelevant unless you're modding Unreal.

Laravel GPT ‚Äî irrelevant (Laravel = PHP web framework).

Code ‚Äî this is general-purpose but can help with debugging and logic.

üî• Recommended Setup for HeadShotV

Stick with GPT-4o

You don‚Äôt need any of the Explore models unless you want extra architectural advice ‚Üí maybe Software Architect GPT

Your mod is C++ native, SHV-based, so avoid anything JS, PHP, or Python-focused

Focus should be on Visual Studio integration, C++ native code, hooking natives, and file validation

üöÄ Final Call:
Task	Best Model	Reason
Writing or fixing mod code	GPT-4o	Full C++/native/SHV support
Designing mod system	Software Architect GPT	Optional, for architecture planning
Anything frontend/web	‚ùå Not applicable	You're not doing web dev
Exploring other GPTs	‚ùå Not needed	GPT-4o already handles everything

Let me know if you want me to test or install one of the Explore tools into your environment to augment GPT-4o, but otherwise, you're already set up optimally.
