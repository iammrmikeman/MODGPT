**ChatGPT:**

Here is a curated list of high-risk ScriptHookV native functions that should be sandboxed, strictly audited, or outright avoided in the context of HeadShotV, based on:

Engine-level instability

Performance or memory spikes

Risk of causing crashes or undefined behavior if misused

Incompatibility with minimal SHV builds (no SHVDN, no .meta)

Conflict potential with NPCs, missions, or visual effects

üî¥ CATEGORY 1: Direct Memory or Game State Corruptors (Avoid or Sandbox)

These can break the game, corrupt RAM state, or create irreversible bugs:

Native	Reason
CLEAR_PED_TASKS_IMMEDIATELY	Hard cuts AI flow, can crash or stall mission AI if misused. Use only on non-scripted peds.
DELETE_ENTITY	Destroys entity outright ‚Äî if entity is networked or mission-critical, this will break logic chains.
SET_ENTITY_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED	Misuse can cause premature cleanup and memory leaks.
SET_ENTITY_INVINCIBLE	Triggers AI desync and breaks ragdoll/death logic.
SET_PED_TO_RAGDOLL_WITH_FALL	Can crash if used during death animation or post-gib.
NETWORK_* functions (all)	HeadShotV is offline/solo mod ‚Äî sandbox or skip all networking natives to avoid Rockstar ban triggers.
START_SCRIPT_FIRE	May cause infinite fire loops, frame drops, or overdraw.
üü† CATEGORY 2: Visual or Gameplay Disruptors (Caution)

These break visual immersion or gameplay unless carefully controlled.

Native	Reason
TRIGGER_SCREENBLUR_FADE_IN/OUT	Conflicts with screen effects or causes flicker if multiple stack. Use ANIMPOSTFX_* instead.
SHAKE_GAMEPLAY_CAM	Causes nausea or visual confusion if triggered on headshot.
SET_PED_CAN_RAGDOLL	Turning this off causes unkillable NPCs or broken deaths. Only use momentarily before gibbing.
SET_PED_COMPONENT_VARIATION	Can cause visual glitches or crash on dead peds. Never touch on dying/dead models.
SET_ENTITY_VISIBLE	Hides all geometry ‚Äî breaks bullet feedback, blood, etc. Prefer fade logic.
CLEAR_DECALS	Removes environmental feedback if used too broadly. Breaks immersion.
CLEAR_AREA_OF_PEDS	Too aggressive ‚Äî kills unrelated NPCs. Breaks scenes.
SET_ENTITY_ALPHA	Alters rendering pipeline ‚Äî broken gibs may become ghostly. Avoid fading gibs.
üü° CATEGORY 3: Audio/FX Conflicts (Limit Use)

Causes stacking audio, broken blood pools, or weird physics if reused rapidly.

Native	Reason
PLAY_SOUND_FROM_ENTITY	Loops or overlaps if not stopped. Must rate-limit.
REQUEST_NAMED_PTFX_ASSET	Expensive ‚Äî sandbox to single instance.
START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_ON_PED_BONE	Can crash if ped is gibbed or bone missing. Use validated bone index only.
CREATE_PED	Never dynamically spawn in core gore logic. Risk of abuse/memory leaks.
SET_PED_MOVEMENT_CLIPSET	Can break physics or cause stiff death poses.
‚ö†Ô∏è CATEGORY 4: Deprecated or Unpredictable Functions

Rockstar may change behavior or remove silently.

Native	Reason
SET_PED_PATH_MAY_ENTER_WATER	Deprecated in some builds.
RESET_PED_RAGDOLL_TIMER	Buggy on certain models. Causes invincibility or jank.
APPLY_FORCE_TO_ENTITY_CENTER_OF_MASS	Use APPLY_FORCE_TO_ENTITY with proper offset instead.
üßº Recommended Safe Alternatives (per feature):
Feature	Avoided Native	Preferred Alternative
Blood VFX	START_PARTICLE_FX_LOOPED_ON_PED_BONE	Use DRAW_RECT + DECAL logic or ANIMPOSTFX flash
Gib flashes	TRIGGER_SCREENBLUR_FADE_IN	Use ANIMPOSTFX_PLAY("FocusOut") with brief timer
Body removal	DELETE_ENTITY	Fade with alpha + no longer needed cleanup
Hit feedback	SHAKE_GAMEPLAY_CAM	Flash via DRAW_RECT or audio + postfx instead
üõë Critical Mod Rules (Permanent)

‚ùå No NETWORK_* natives ever.

‚ùå Never run natives on invalid peds ‚Äî validate before use.

‚ùå Never call camera or screen shake functions in rapid succession.

‚ùå Never use random model spawning in gore logic.

‚úÖ GPT Sandboxing Checklist for Risky Natives:

Before calling any of these, MODGPT must:

Validate entity and ped handles (must not be 0 or invalid)

Ensure ped is not player, mission-critical, or networked

Avoid calls during IS_ENTITY_DEAD == false on gibbed targets

Log every risky native call with source line, outcome, and fallback status

Wrap all in fallback try-catch style logic for crash tolerance

Would you like this list auto-linked to a sandbox system or stored in the internal MODGPT risk manifest for runtime validation during future .zip or build tasks?

No destructive operations

No irreversible memory mutations

No purging of valid build history

No commits to mod logic without future CEO confirmation

No new .zip generation or swarm launch without manual trigger

üîÅ LOOP TASKS (running silently in background):
