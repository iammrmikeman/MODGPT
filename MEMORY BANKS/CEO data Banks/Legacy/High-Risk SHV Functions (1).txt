Create a list of all high-risk ScriptHookV functions for HeadShotV that should be sandboxed or avoided.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a curated list of high-risk ScriptHookV native functions that should either be sandboxed, replaced with safer alternatives, or avoided entirely in the context of HeadShotV, particularly due to its high-impact gore, model swapping, and visual effect focus. These functions are flagged due to potential instability, game crashes, anti-cheat detection, or excessive engine interference.

üî¥ HIGH-RISK NATIVE FUNCTIONS FOR HEADSHOTV

These should be avoided or sandboxed unless explicitly tested and justified. Many of them can cause crashes, memory corruption, or desyncs.

üö´ 1. Memory and Object Deletion Natives

These can crash the game or cause undefined behavior if used on invalid or shared entities.

DELETE_ENTITY(Entity* entity)

SET_ENTITY_AS_NO_LONGER_NEEDED(Entity* entity)

MARK_OBJECT_FOR_DELETION(Object object)

REMOVE_PARTICLE_FX_IN_RANGE

REMOVE_DECALS_IN_RANGE

SET_ENTITY_COORDS_NO_OFFSET

Risks:

Invalid references during VFX/gore cleanup.

Interferes with Rockstar‚Äôs internal object pool lifecycle.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Model and Ped Manipulation

Used incorrectly, these can cause T-pose bugs, asset race conditions, or even corrupt saves.

SET_PED_COMPONENT_VARIATION

SET_PED_PROP_INDEX

SET_PED_MODEL_IS_SUPPRESSED

SET_PED_RANDOM_COMPONENT_VARIATION

SET_PED_HEAD_OVERLAY

Risks:

Unexpected model fallback, especially during ragdoll states.

Asset LODs may not fully load when these are used mid-frame.

üß† 3. Direct AI Control and Combat Override

Interferes with Rockstar‚Äôs AI state machine. May lead to aim desync, bad animation blends, or stuck NPCs.

TASK_SHOOT_AT_COORD

SET_PED_CAN_BE_TARGETTED

SET_PED_FLEE_ATTRIBUTES

SET_PED_COMBAT_ATTRIBUTES

SET_PED_RAGDOLL_ON_COLLISION

CLEAR_PED_TASKS_IMMEDIATELY

Risks:

May break combat state machines or prevent damage registration.

Can unintentionally cancel engine-triggered effects like bullet flinch.

üî• 4. Physics and Force Manipulation

Unsafe if applied without bounding box validation or force checks.

APPLY_FORCE_TO_ENTITY

SET_ENTITY_VELOCITY

SET_PED_TO_RAGDOLL

SET_ENTITY_DYNAMIC

SET_PED_CAN_RAGDOLL_FROM_PLAYER_IMPACT

Risks:

Overpowered physics impulses can crash physics threads or shoot bodies into invalid zones.

Overlaps with Rockstar‚Äôs internal ragdoll solver.

üß® 5. VFX + Explosion Manipulation

Detonation and FX natives that directly tamper with engine zones.

ADD_EXPLOSION

START_PARTICLE_FX_LOOPED_ON_ENTITY

USE_PARTICLE_FX_ASSET

START_NETWORKED_PARTICLE_FX

Risks:

Can crash low-end GPUs or overload the FX queue.

Risk of stack overflows when spawning VFX mid-death animation.

üï≥Ô∏è 6. Ped Cloning and Spawning

Risky in synchronized scenes or when used rapidly.

CREATE_PED

CLONE_PED

SET_PED_CLONE_DELETE_ON_DEATH

Risks:

Engine may fail to assign correct AI metadata.

Possible visual desync with animation sets.

‚õî 7. Dangerous Rendering / UI Natives

Can create rendering glitches, stuck UI overlays, or screen blackouts.

DRAW_RECT

DRAW_SPRITE

SET_TIMECYCLE_MODIFIER

SET_NO_LOADING_SCREEN

Risks:

Persistent visual glitches if not cleaned up properly.

May permanently override postFX unless manually reset.

üß¨ 8. Experimental or Undocumented Natives

Used without full parameter validation, these are landmines.

PLAY_PED_RINGTONE

SET_PED_PLAYS_HEAD_ON_HORN_ANIM_WHEN_DIES_IN_VEHICLE

EXPLODE_VEHICLE_IN_CUTSCENE

Risks:

May crash when used outside the mission framework or during cutscenes.

‚úÖ RECOMMENDED SANDBOX RULE

For HeadShotV, all of the above functions should:

Be wrapped in a validation layer: e.g., entity existence, frame delay buffering, asset preloading checks.

Only execute in a designated safe-frame window (i.e., not mid-ragdoll or during cinematic camera override).

Be disabled in online-compatible or passive test modes.

Log all uses in a per-frame debug trace during development.

Optional Enhancements

If sandboxing is too heavy-handed for early builds:

Introduce a debug flag to toggle experimental native usage.

Use frame-based health-check loop before allowing any entity mutation or deletion.

Would you like a templated SafeCall C++ system to sandbox these with logging and recovery? Or should I begin building the NativeShield module for HeadShotV integration?
