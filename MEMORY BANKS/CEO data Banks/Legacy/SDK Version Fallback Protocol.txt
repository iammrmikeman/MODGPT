**You:**

Design an SDK version negotiation protocol so GPT knows when to fall back to older SDK mappings if newer ones break builds.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here is a proposed SDK Version Negotiation Protocol for MODGPT. It ensures the GPT can automatically detect, validate, and gracefully fall back to older or alternate ScriptHookV SDK versions when newer ones cause errors or incompatibility. The system should be:

Resilient (can always complete the build even with partial damage)

Traceable (builds always declare what SDK version was used and why)

Smart (learns from prior failures to avoid repeating mistakes)

🔧 MODGPT SDK Version Negotiation Protocol (v1.0)
🧠 Core Goals
Goal	Description
Build Continuity	If an SDK version breaks the build, fallback must be automatic and non-blocking.
Confidence Tracking	Each SDK version has a live confidence score per mod type, based on real test results.
Historical Memory	GPT remembers which SDK worked for which builds and mod styles.
Smart Downgrade	If newer SDKs fail, the fallback is not the oldest, but the most stable proven version.
🔁 Step-by-Step Protocol
1. Pre-Build SDK Fingerprint Check

Before build, MODGPT checks:

.lib linkage integrity (ScriptHookV.lib)

Header presence and syntax of:

natives.h, types.h, keyboard.h, script.h, main.h, etc.

#define macros for SDK version detection

Known signatures (e.g., comment blocks with version strings)

✅ If valid → proceed.
❌ If damaged/missing → downgrade protocol activates.

2. Version Confidence Matrix (VCM) Lookup

MODGPT maintains a matrix:

SDK Version	Known Issues	Confidence	Last Used With
1.0.617.1a	None	100%	HeadShotV v0.1.1
1.0.2189.0	Missing natives	60%	None
3521.0_814.9	Stable for Enhanced	95%	TestMod_5secflash

MODGPT checks:

Which SDK is marked stable for the current mod type

Which SDK last succeeded with similar structure

3. SDK Try Sequence

If the default SDK fails:

plaintext
[!] SDK v3521.0_814.9 build failed due to unresolved native: "PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND"
[~] Checking fallback order...

→ Trying SDK v1.0.617.1a... SUCCESS
→ Updating VCM: Marking v3521.0_814.9 confidence -20% for this mod type


Fallback order is not linear:

Use confidence-weighted retry logic

If fallback fails too → revert to emergency SDK (minimal known-good one)

4. Post-Build Logging

Every successful or failed build logs:

SDK version used

Confidence delta

Any native mismatches

SDK source hash

json
{
  "sdk_version_used": "1.0.617.1a",
  "fallback_triggered": true,
  "confidence_delta": "+10%",
  "unresolved_natives": [],
  "sdk_hash": "b4c92...9f"
}

🔁 Protocol State Machine (Simplified)

stateDiagram
    [*] --> ValidateSDK
    ValidateSDK --> UseSDK : valid
    ValidateSDK --> Fallback : invalid or partial
    Fallback --> RetryWithLowerConfidence
    RetryWithLowerConfidence --> UseSDK : success
    RetryWithLowerConfidence --> EmergencySDK : all fail
    EmergencySDK --> UseSDK
    UseSDK --> LogResults
    LogResults --> [*]

🚨 Optional Emergency Fallback SDK

Always keep a Minimal SDK (with only core native linkage) ready:

Only has natives.h and script.h

Minimal main.cpp stub with 1-2 native calls (e.g. WAIT, PRINT_STRING)

Used when no full SDK builds succeed

🧠 GPT Memory Use

MODGPT must persist confidence scores per SDK version, tagged by:

Mod name (HeadShotV)

Mod type (.asi, .dll, ScriptHookV)

Build ID (v0.3.4-beta)

Example:

json
"HeadShotV": {
  "asi": {
    "1.0.617.1a": 100,
    "3521.0_814.9": 85,
    "2189.0": 35
  }
}

✅ Benefits
Feature	Benefit
Dynamic fallback	Mod builds don’t fail hard on SDK issues
Memory-based reasoning	Reuses success history for optimal builds
Confidence-based scoring	Builds improve over time automatically
Trust-chain logging	Trace every build to exact SDK origin

Would you like this implemented as:

A .cmd swarm handler (sdk_resolver.cmd)?

An internal MODGPT module?

A live log/tracker (sdk_confidence.json) for GPT inspection and manual override?
