**ChatGPT:**

Here is the formal Safety Override Logic design for halting mod builds when critical SDK files are missing, mismatched, or outdated. This system is designed for MODGPT to ensure build integrity, trust, and prevention of silent corruption or dependency rot.

üîí MODGPT SAFETY OVERRIDE SYSTEM: SDK INTEGRITY CHECK (v1.0)
üîß PURPOSE

To immediately halt any mod build if any of the following SDK conditions are met:

Missing: A required SDK file (e.g., natives.h, script.h, scripthookv.lib) is not found.

Mismatched: A file has the wrong version (based on signature, hash, or content structure).

Outdated: A file exists but does not meet the minimum required SDK version for this mod.

‚öôÔ∏è CORE LOGIC PIPELINE
Step 1: üîç SDK Manifest Declaration

Every mod must include or inherit a structured file:

json
{
  "sdk_required": "ScriptHookV",
  "sdk_version_required": "1.0.617.1a",
  "critical_files": [
    "natives.h",
    "script.h",
    "scripthookv.lib",
    "main.h"
  ],
  "hashes": {
    "natives.h": "F2D3...AB12",
    "script.h": "3A4F...C109",
    "scripthookv.lib": "D7A8...EF21",
    "main.h": "9F7B...DDDD"
  }
}


This manifest forms the contract for what constitutes a valid SDK environment.

Step 2: üß† Preflight Scan

Triggered before every build, MODGPT will:

Locate SDK folder(s) (e.g., external/ScriptHookV/)

Check for all critical_files

Hash each file and compare with manifest.hashes

Read internal markers (e.g., #define VERSION) for semantic versioning

Step 3: ‚ö†Ô∏è Override Triggers

The build is forcibly halted if any of the following is true:

Condition	Description	Error Type
File missing	A required file is not found	FATAL
File hash mismatch	The file exists but is not the same version as declared	FATAL
Semantic version too low	File content reveals SDK version is outdated (even if hash matches)	FATAL
File size suspicious	File size is 0 bytes or unusually small (often placeholder or corrupt)	FATAL
Step 4: üìÑ Override Response Template

If any fatal condition is met:

plaintext
üö´ BUILD HALTED: SDK INTEGRITY FAILURE

‚ùå Missing or mismatched SDK files detected:
  - [x] natives.h ‚Üí Hash mismatch (expected F2D3...AB12)
  - [ ] script.h ‚Üí OK
  - [x] scripthookv.lib ‚Üí File not found
  - [x] main.h ‚Üí SDK version "1.0.505.2" is below required "1.0.617.1a"

üõë Build terminated to prevent unsafe compilation.

üß† Tip: Restore official SDK files from a verified source or reinitialize from known-trusted zip.

üîÑ Step 5: Auto-Recovery Option (Optional if Approved)

If auto_repair = true in system settings, MODGPT may:

Attempt to restore SDK files from a trusted local cache

If no valid recovery is available, fallback to hard halt with instructions

üîê EXTENSIONS AND HARDENING

Checksum Validation: Add SHA-256 or stronger digest verification.

Signed SDKs: Require .sig signatures for high-integrity builds (future).

Tamper Detection: Add detection for extra or modified functions (e.g., unauthorized #pragma comment(lib, ...) edits).

Mod-Type Enforcement: Only allow SHV SDKs for .asi mods; block SHVDN references unless whitelisted.

‚úÖ TRUST ELEVATION

If a mod passes this SDK check 5 times consecutively without override violations:

It may be granted trusted_sdk=true status, reducing scan depth to hashes only (configurable).

ETA for Implementation

Initial version (hash-based halt): 2‚Äì3 hours to deploy for MODGPT system-wide.

Full version (semantic parsing + auto-repair + version fallback): 6‚Äì8 hours depending on mod complexity and SDK variations.

Would you like me to begin integrating this logic into MODGPT now, or adjust any parameters (e.g., soft warnings vs fatal halt)?
