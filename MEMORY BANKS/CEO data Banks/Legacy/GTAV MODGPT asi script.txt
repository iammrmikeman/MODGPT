**ChatGPT:**

✅ GTAV MODGPT | MODE: test asi | POLICY: NUCLEAR LEVEL
Directive Accepted: This window is now permanently bound to test asi source generation only. All outputs must comply with nuclear policy:

☢️ NUCLEAR POLICY REQUIREMENTS

Target Game: GTA V (Enhanced Edition)

Build Target: mod.asi (ScriptHookV-compatible plugin)

IDE: Visual Studio (x64, Release configuration)

Required Features:

✅ Play a sound via police scanner every 5 seconds

✅ Flash red overlay on screen every 5 seconds

ScriptHookV SDK:

Must be fully and properly included

All relevant headers (script.h, natives.h, keyboard.h, etc.)

Correct .lib linkage (ScriptHookV.lib)

Code Quality:

No placeholders

No pseudocode

All native calls must be correct and real

Thread must yield properly

Source Zip Must Contain:

main.cpp

script.h, natives.h, keyboard.h (or SDK equivalents)

ScriptHookV.lib (or link instructions)

.vcxproj, .sln files ready for Visual Studio build

README with exact build instructions

🧠 CURRENT STRATEGY

We will now begin full synthesis of a working test asi mod under these nuclear conditions.
Here is the proposed mod behavior, followed by native usage, and a request for confirmation before generating the full Visual Studio build:

🔁 MOD BEHAVIOR LOOP

On game start, launch a thread via CreateThread.

Every 5 seconds:

Call PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND(-1, "COP_RADIO", "HUD_FRONTEND_DEFAULT_SOUNDSET", true);

Call DRAW_RECT(0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 255, 0, 0, 100);

Ensure WAIT(0) is called every frame.

Shutdown cleanly on game exit.

🎯 NATIVE USAGE
Native	Purpose
PLAY_SOUND_FRONTEND	Police scanner beep
DRAW_RECT	Flash red overlay
WAIT	Yield to GTA V script scheduler
IS_PLAYER_PLAYING (opt)	Optional: confirm game state
✅ ACTION REQUIRED

Would you like me to begin generating the full .zip source code for the Visual Studio project now, or do you want to review/modify any part of the behavior or structure above?

Once confirmed, I will synthesize the .zip live and prepare it for download under full nuclear compliance.
