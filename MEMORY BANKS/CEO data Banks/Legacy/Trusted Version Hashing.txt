**ChatGPT:**

To ensure full version traceability for all .zip mod builds, MODGPT must implement a trusted version hashing mechanism that captures every input, transformation, and artifact involved in a build. This guarantees deterministic, auditable version lineage and prevents unauthorized or undetected changes. Below is a professional-grade system proposal.

ðŸ”’ MODGPT Trusted Version Hashing System (TVHS)
ðŸ”§ Core Objectives

Immutable Build Identification â€“ each .zip must have a unique, deterministic hash.

Source Traceability â€“ every file and setting involved in the build must be recorded and hashed.

Tamper Detection â€“ any post-build alteration must invalidate the trusted hash.

Build Reproducibility â€“ if given the same inputs, MODGPT must generate the same zip and hash.

ðŸ“¦ TVHS Design Overview
1. Input Hashing: srchash

Scope: Hash of only the contents of the src build folder (recursive, sorted, canonicalized).

Method:

python
srchash = SHA256(sorted(flatten(all_file_contents(src_folder))))


Purpose: Guarantees source integrity and uniquely identifies the mod logic and assets used.

2. Build Environment Fingerprint: envhash

Scope: Captures ScriptHookV SDK version, compiler version, GPT build system version, and system time.

Composition:

json
{
  "compiler": "MSVC 19.38.33135",
  "sdk_version": "SHV_1.0.617.1a",
  "gpt_version": "MODGPT_v0.01b",
  "build_time_utc": "2025-06-07T22:51:00Z"
}


Hash: envhash = SHA256(json.dumps(env_dict, sort_keys=True))

Purpose: Detects environmental drifts or miscompiles caused by platform inconsistencies.

3. Manifest Hashing: manihash

Scope: The canonicalized manifest.json file in the build.

Key Rule: Manifest must be complete before hashing â€” no TODOs or empty fields.

Purpose: Ensures declared metadata matches the actual build.

4. Final Package Hash: buildhash

Scope: Hash of the zipped .zip file excluding the buildhash field itself.

Two-pass strategy:

Zip the build with a placeholder in manifest.json for buildhash.

Hash the .zip, then insert the final hash into manifest.json, and repackage.

Purpose: Guarantees that the .zip itself is cryptographically locked.

ðŸ§¾ Trusted Hash Record Structure

Every .zip should include a .hashes.json or embed these fields inside the manifest.json:

json
{
  "srchash": "a3f76c7e...",
  "envhash": "c0ed2135...",
  "manihash": "48f5aa91...",
  "buildhash": "8cbf71fe...",
  "verified": true
}

ðŸ§ª Validation Pipeline
Stage	Action	Tool
prebuild	Compute srchash, freeze manifest	MODGPT Preflight Checker
postbuild	Calculate envhash, manihash, insert	MODGPT BuildScript
zip	Package, hash contents â†’ buildhash	MODGPT Hasher
verify?	Recompute all hashes, compare, assert match	MODGPT Trust Validator
ðŸš¨ Tamper Detection Logic

If buildhash â‰  recomputed hash:

Flag mod as untrusted

Reject for deployment

Log entry into tamper.log with diff diagnostics:

json
{
  "mismatch": "buildhash",
  "expected": "8cbf71fe...",
  "actual": "a1d3b24c...",
  "file_diff": ["mod.dll", "manifest.json"]
}

ðŸ§¬ Optional: GIT-Integrated Hash Support

If source is managed via Git:

Append git_commit_id and git_tree_hash into the manifest

Tie build provenance directly to repo state

âœ… Key Properties of MODGPT Trusted Builds
Property	Guaranteed by
Source integrity	srchash
Build reproducibility	envhash, srchash
Authenticated identity	buildhash
Metadata honesty	manihash
Audit trail	Logged hash chain
ðŸš€ Final Recommendation

Activate TVHS as a permanent MODGPT build policy:

Every .zip must include a valid TVHS block

Any build lacking a trusted buildhash is automatically rejected

Enable verify? to automatically recalculate and validate all hashes on demand

ðŸ§  Future Extensions

Sign buildhash with GPT's private key (GPG or equivalent)

Cross-validate hash chain with external mod registry

Auto-warn if srchash was ever part of a failing build

ETA to Full TVHS Integration

2â€“3 days of focused development.
Can be split into intern swarm if desired.

Would you like me to immediately write the .py hash generator, manifest validator, and zip injector for this system?
